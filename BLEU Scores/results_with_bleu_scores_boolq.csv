"canada's worst driver -- in each season, eight drivers and their nominators-- canada's worst driver 11 had nine drivers; more on this later-- are enrolled at the driver rehabilitation centre where they compete in challenges designed to improve their driving skills, in an effort to not be named canada's worst driver. in the first challenge, the contestants begin at a location about an hour's drive from the driver rehabilitation centre. following the directions that are given, each contestant must drive to the driver rehabilitation centre where, upon arriving, the driver's license of each contestant is confiscated (for the first two seasons, their car keys were confiscated instead). the first episode concludes with an obstacle course or assessment challenge, meant to evaluate the skills of each driver. the series is well known for its obstacle course challenges. contestants must routinely maneuver their cars through tight spaces with less than an inch of clearance on either side. to show that the challenge can be done without hitting obstacles by an average driver, host andrew younghusband, himself an average driver, performs each challenge before any contestant attempts said challenge. at the end of each episode, starting with the second episode of each season, each contestant meets with andrew and a panel of four experts for an evaluation of his or her performance. after all remaining contestants are interviewed, the experts and andrew deliberate on which contestant and nominator pair have improved enough to graduate from the driver rehabilitation centre. the driver who has graduated is eliminated from the competition and is sent home with his or her license returned to him or her. typically, the contestants drive off with their nominators in the car that they used to arrive at the driver rehabilitation centre. during the series, the experts also reserve the right to not graduate anyone during an episode or to graduate multiple contestants at the same time. the experts may also choose to expel any contestant prematurely who does not show any incentive to learn, who they believe should not continue driving or who can not continue the rehabilitation program often for medical or legal reasons. in this particular instance, certain contestants are eliminated from the competition and their licenses are returned and they are given a ride home by their nominators. however, a prematurely expelled contestant or contestant who refuses to continue may still be considered for the title, as was the case in canada's worst driver ever, in which dale pitton was expelled in the second-to-last episode, only to be brought back for the trophy presentation. in extreme cases, the experts may contact the relevant ministry of transport and request that a driver's license be put up for review, if they believe that a contestant is medically unfit to continue driving. to date, this has happened only twice, in canada's worst driver 4 with donna hicks and canada's worst driver ever with dale. the elimination process continues until only three contestants remain (the original intent was for two contestants to remain, but due to the first season containing an episode in which no one graduated, there were three; every subsequent season has had three finalists). those three finalists are then given the final challenge, which is typically a three-in-a-car forward-backward slalom within a certain time limit, followed by the mega challenge, an obstacle course with elements of almost every previous challenge (the standard transmission balancing challenge, among others, is not part of the mega challenge, but every challenge that is practical to include does get included), as well as a driving examination through the busy streets of a major urban centre in canada near the driver rehabilitation centre (since season seven, the road test has been in hamilton, ontario). based on these three challenges, the experts determine which among the three is canada's worst driver. with the exception of the eighth season, in which both kevin simmons and flora wang were named canada's worst driver, the contestant who fared the second-worst is deemed to not have graduated from the driver rehabilitation centre, while the contestant who fared the third-worst is considered a graduate (with the exception of the eleventh season, in which, despite faring the third-worst, sholom hoffman failed to graduate). unlike other versions of the worst driver series around the world, where being eliminated early is rewarded with a new car while the worst driver has their car destroyed, canada's worst driver awards no prizes aside from a trophy for being named the worst, as the point of the show is to educate rather than entertain.","canada's worst driver -- so check it, every season, they pick like eight (sometimes nine) folks who really can't drive and their homies who nominated them, and they all head to the driver rehabilitation centre. they tryna get better at driving so they ain’t called canada's worst driver. the first thing they gotta do is drive there from about an hour away, following the directions given. when they pull up, they gotta hand over their driver's licenses (used to be car keys in the first couple seasons). they wrap up the first episode with some tough driving test or obstacle course to see where their skills at.

this show's big on those wild obstacle challenges, man. they be driving through tight spots with barely any room to breathe. the host, andrew younghusband, who's just an average driver, he does each challenge first to show it's doable. after the second episode, contestants gotta meet up with andrew and four experts to talk about how they did. depending on how they've improved, they might graduate from the program, which means they out of the competition and get their license back. they dip out in the same whip they came in.

"implications of puerto rico's current political status -- constitutionally, puerto rico is subject to the congress' plenary powers under the territorial clause of article iv, sec. 3, of the u.s. constitution. u.s. federal law applies to puerto rico, even though puerto rico is not a state of the american union and their residents have no voting representation in the u.s. congress. because of the establishment of the federal relations act of 1950, all federal laws that are ``not locally inapplicable'' are automatically the law of the land in puerto rico. following the 1950 and 1952 legislation, only two district court decisions have held that a particular federal law, which does not specifically exclude or treat puerto rico differently, is inapplicable to puerto rico. the more recent decision was vacated on appeal. efrén rivera ramos, dean and professor of law at the university of puerto rico school of law, clarified the meaning of plenary powers, explaining, ``the government of a state derives its powers from the people of the state, whereas the government of a territory owes its existence wholly to the united states. the court thus seems to equate plenary power to exclusive power. the u.s. government could exert over the territory power that it could not exercise over the states.'' ramos quotes justice harlan, writing in grafton v. united states, 206 u.s. 333 (1907), ``the jurisdiction and authority of the united states over that territory (referring to the philippines) and its inhabitants, for all legitimate purposes of government is paramount,''. ramos then goes on to argue ``this power, however, is not absolute, for it is restrained by some then-undefined fundamental rights possessed by anyone subject to the authority of the u.s. government.''","so, check it out, puerto rico's whole political setup is kinda unique. constitutionally, puerto rico falls under the full control of the u.s. congress because of this rule in the constitution called the territorial clause. what this means is, even though puerto rico ain't a state and the folks there can't vote in the u.s. congress, u.s. federal laws still apply over there. back in 1950, this law called the federal relations act made it so that all federal laws that fit with puerto rico’s situation automatically apply there.

since this law kicked in during the 1950s, there have been only a couple of court cases where they decided a federal law didn't apply to puerto rico unless the law specifically said it didn't or treated puerto rico differently. the most recent case like that even got overturned.

now, there's this law professor, efrén rivera ramos, who’s been breaking down what these powers really mean. he says that while a state’s government gets its power from its people, a territory like puerto rico gets its powers from the united states. the courts seem to think this gives the u.s. government a lot of control, more than it would have over the states.

now, this concept comes from thermal radiation theory, which digs into how heat acts on the super small scale, like with atoms and sub-atomic particles, using quantum mechanics. back in the day, in 1879, this dude from slovenia named josef stefan came up with this constant. then, a few years later in 1884, another brainy guy, ludwig boltzmann from austria, went ahead and derived it. you can also pull this equation from something called planck's law if you integrate over all possible wavelengths at a certain temp, imagining you got this tiny, flat, black box.

"global financial system -- an important component of the bretton woods agreements was the creation of two new international financial institutions, the international monetary fund (imf) and the international bank for reconstruction and development (ibrd). collectively referred to as the bretton woods institutions, they became operational in 1947 and 1946 respectively. the imf was established to support the monetary system by facilitating cooperation on international monetary issues, providing advisory and technical assistance to members, and offering emergency lending to nations experiencing repeated difficulties restoring the balance of payments equilibrium. members would contribute funds to a pool according to their share of gross world product, from which emergency loans could be issued. member states were authorized and encouraged to employ capital controls as necessary to manage payments imbalances and meet pegging targets, but prohibited from relying on imf financing to cover particularly short-term capital hemorrhages. while the imf was instituted to guide members and provide a short-term financing window for recurrent balance of payments deficits, the ibrd was established to serve as a type of financial intermediary for channeling global capital toward long-term investment opportunities and postwar reconstruction projects. the creation of these organizations was a crucial milestone in the evolution of the international financial architecture, and some economists consider it the most significant achievement of multilateral cooperation following world war ii. since the establishment of the international development association (ida) in 1960, the ibrd and ida are together known as the world bank. while the ibrd lends to middle-income developing countries, the ida extends the bank's lending program by offering concessional loans and grants to the world's poorest nations.","global financial system -- so check it, right after the bretton woods agreements, they set up two big money institutions, the international monetary fund (imf) and the international bank for reconstruction and development (ibrd). people usually call 'em the bretton woods institutions. they started doing their thing in 1947 and 1946. the imf was all about keeping the money system smooth, helping countries work together on money matters, giving advice, and stepping in with cash when countries kept running into money troubles. countries had to put money into a big pot based on how big they were on the global market, and that money could be used for emergency loans.

now, these member countries could use some controls on their capital to handle payment issues and hit their targets, but they couldn't just use imf money for quick fixes when they were bleeding cash short-term. while the imf was there to guide and help with short-term money problems, the ibrd was like a middleman, pushing global capital towards long-term investments and helping rebuild stuff after the war. setting up these organizations was a key point in building up the international financial system, and some smart folks think it was the biggest thing to come out of countries working together after world war ii.

"stop sign -- stop sign placement can pose an additional challenge to users. there is a tradeoff between the salient visual cues provided by increased limit line setback, and the crucial time that is lost in approaching the intersection from behind that line; being closer can provide a few additional seconds requisite for safe transit. however, common creeping into the intersection past the limit line causes drivers to lose the invaluable perspective of the visual acuity of lateral motion, crippling them to the more dangerous savt. this makes it very difficult to estimate the movement of oncoming traffic. as intersections are not engineered to be used this way, the traffic flow ideals have broken down when drivers consistently choose this method as the safer alternative. stop signs are accompanied with a limit line, which has a mandatory setback distance which is often not less than 15 feet. while it may be negligence per se to prematurely pass the stop limit line, drivers may be unfairly denied sufficient time gap or opportunity to enter otherwise because of the through-traffic flow and speed; the inherent problem with this traffic control device. while stop signs are a relatively inexpensive method of traffic management, they can be expensive from perspective of the damage they cause users. pricey but safer traffic signals, roundabouts, and traffic circles are alternatively used where traffic flow dictates it is inappropriate to use a stop sign. it is just as crucial for law enforcement to regulate traffic through-speed that is above the assured clear distance ahead ahead as it is to cite stop sign runners for this device to be a viable option.","stop sign issues -- where they put stop signs can make it hard for folks. there's this thing where if they set the line you gotta stop at further back, you see better, but then you lose time getting to the crossroads. if you're closer, you got a few extra seconds which helps crossing safely. but, folks tend to creep past that stop line, and that messes up their side view, making it tough to see cars coming from the sides, which is risky. this ain't how intersections should work, and when everybody starts doing this thinking it's safer, the whole traffic flow gets messed up.

stop signs got this line you can't cross until you stop, and it's usually at least 15 feet back. if you cross it too soon, that's technically breaking the rule, but sometimes drivers do it cause they ain't given enough time to safely join the main traffic due to how fast the main traffic is flowing. this is a big issue with stop signs.

when you work with a therapist in ct, it's all about teaming up to build skills that let you test and change your beliefs, recognize when your thinking is off, interact with others in new ways, and switch up how you act. the therapist helps put together a special plan that makes sense of what you're feeling on the inside, picks the right steps to take, and spots the things that stress you out.",is cognitive therapy the same as cognitive behavioural therapy,"nah, they ain't exactly the same. cognitive therapy mostly deals with ya thoughts and how they affect how you feel. cognitive behavioral therapy, or cbt, it takes it a step further by also working on ya behaviors too. so, it's like cognitive therapy but with an extra focus on changing actions too.",6.706578220639057,1.8921095901943767,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
"closed communion -- the catholic church distinguishes between churches whose celebration of the eucharist, as well as holy orders, it recognizes as valid and those of other christian communities. in the case that it is impossible to approach a catholic minister, that it is a case of real need or spiritual benefit,and that the danger of error or indifferentism is avoided, the catholic church permits its faithful to receive communion in orthodox churches, although orthodox churches do not honour this and only permit orthodox christians to receive communion in orthodox churches. the catholic church does not ordinarily allow a catholic to receive communion in a protestant church, since it does not consider protestant ministers to be priests ordained by bishops in a line of valid succession from the apostles, although lutherans, moravians, and anglicans teach that they ordain their clergy in lines of apostolic succession. it applies this rule also to the anglican communion, pursuant to apostolicae curae, a position that the church of england disputed in saepius officio.","closed communion -- so here’s how it goes down in the catholic church: they got a list of churches they cool with when it comes to how they do the eucharist and who they got as ministers. but, if you're stuck and can’t get to a catholic priest, and you really need it or it’s gonna help you spiritually, and long as it don’t lead to no confusion or mixing up beliefs, then the catholic church is alright with its folks getting communion from the orthodox churches. but peep this, the orthodox churches ain’t down for returning the favor; they only let their own members take communion.

now, when it comes to protestant churches, the catholic church usually ain’t letting their members get communion there. they don’t see protestant ministers as legit priests since they ain’t got that direct line back to the apostles like they believe their own priests do. even though groups like the lutherans, moravians, and anglicans say they keep to that apostolic succession, the catholic church still holds them to the same rule, especially after they laid down the law in apostolicae curae. the church of england wasn’t having it and clapped back with saepius officio, but that’s how it’s set",can a catholic receive communion in an episcopal church,can a catholic get communion at an episcopal church?,9.531308770249277,27.301208627090666,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1

"defibrillation -- as devices that can quickly produce dramatic improvements in patient health, defibrillators are often depicted in movies, television, video games and other fictional media. their function, however, is often exaggerated, with the defibrillator inducing a sudden, violent jerk or convulsion by the patient; in reality, although the muscles may contract, such dramatic patient presentation is rare. similarly, medical providers are often depicted defibrillating patients with a ``flat-line'' ecg rhythm (also known as asystole). this is not normal medical practice, as the heart cannot be restarted by the defibrillator itself. only the cardiac arrest rhythms ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia are normally defibrillated. the purpose of defibrillation is to depolarize the entire heart all at once so that it is synchronized, in the hope that it will resume beating normally. someone who is already in asystole cannot be helped by electrical means, and usually needs urgent cpr and intravenous medication. there are also several heart rhythms that can be ``shocked'' when the patient is not in cardiac arrest, such as supraventricular tachycardia and ventricular tachycardia that produces a pulse; this more-complicated procedure is known as cardioversion, not defibrillation.","defibrillators — these devices can make a big difference real quick for folks who sick. you might’ve seen 'em in movies or on tv where they make the patient jump like they got hit by lightning. but for real, though, it don't go down like that most times. the way hollywood show it is extra; folks don't usually flip out that hard from it.
