do good samaritan laws protect those who help at an accident,do good samaritan laws got yo back if you help out at an accident?,"Good Samaritan law -- Good Samaritan laws offer legal protection to people who give reasonable assistance to those who are, or who they believe to be, injured, ill, in peril, or otherwise incapacitated. The protection is intended to reduce bystanders' hesitation to assist, for fear of being sued or prosecuted for unintentional injury or wrongful death. An example of such a law in common-law areas of Canada: a good Samaritan doctrine is a legal principle that prevents a rescuer who has voluntarily helped a victim in distress from being successfully sued for wrongdoing. Its purpose is to keep people from being reluctant to help a stranger in need for fear of legal repercussions should they make some mistake in treatment. By contrast, a duty to rescue law requires people to offer assistance and holds those who fail to do so liable.","Good Samaritan law -- Good Samaritan laws give legal backup to folks who step up to help others who look hurt, sick, in danger, or can't help themselves. These laws are there to make sure people ain't scared to help out, worrying they might get sued or face charges if they accidentally cause harm or someone dies. For instance, up in Canada, the Good Samaritan rule is a legal thing that says if you willingly help someone in trouble, you can't be taken to court for messing up. It's all about making sure people don't hesitate to lend a hand to a stranger in need because they're scared of getting into legal trouble if they don't do everything perfect. On the flip side, a duty to rescue law says you gotta help out, and if you don't, you could be held responsible."

What's up?","Federal judiciary of the United States -- The federal courts are composed of three levels of courts. The Supreme Court of the United States is the court of last resort. It is generally an appellate court that operates under discretionary review, which means that the Court can choose which cases to hear, by granting writs of certiorari. There is therefore generally no basic right of appeal that extends automatically all the way to the Supreme Court. In a few situations (like lawsuits between state governments or some cases between the federal government and a state) it sits as a court of original jurisdiction.","U.S. Federal Courts -- Aight, so the federal courts got like three levels. At the top, you got the Supreme Court, that's the big boss court. It mostly handles appeals, but it gets to pick which cases it wanna hear by giving out these things called writs of certiorari.

does a penalty shoot out goal count towards the golden boot,do goals from a penalty shootout count towards the golden boot?,"Penalty shoot-out (association football) -- A shoot-out is usually considered for statistical purposes to be separate from the match which preceded it.

does age have any influence on attentional ability or inattentional blindness,Do age affect how well folks pay attention or not notice things?,"Inattentional blindness -- In a 2015 study, Cary Stothart, Walter Boot, and Daniel Simons attempted to replicate and extend the findings from both Graham and Burke's 2011 study and Steven Most and colleague's 2000 study on Amazon Mechanical Turk using a sample of 515 participants that varied in age. In this study, participants were tasked with counting the number of times a number of white moving objects crossed the vertical midpoint of a display while ignoring a number of black moving objects. The unexpected object in this case was a gray cross that moved horizontally across the display at various distances from the vertical midpoint (this was manipulated between participants). Overall, they found that inattentional blindness susceptibility increases with age, which replicates the finding from Graham and Burke. In fact, they found that every 10 years of age was associated with a 1.3 fold increase in the probability of displaying inattentional blindness. They also found that the probability of inattentional blindness increases as the distance between the observer's focus of attention and the unexpected object increases, which replicates the finding from Most and colleagues. However, they also found that the relationship that age has with inattentional blindness does not change as a function of the unexpected object's distance from the focus of attention, suggesting that useful field of view does not mediate the relationship between age and inattentional blindness.","Inattentional blindness study in 2015 -- So, Cary Stothart, Walter Boot, and Daniel Simons was tryna see if they could get the same results as them studies from Graham and Burke in 2011 and Steven Most and them from back in 2000. They used Amazon Mechanical Turk and had like 515 folks doing this thing where they had to count how many times these white objects moved across the middle of a screen, but they wasn’t supposed to pay no mind to the black objects moving too. Now, the thing they wasn't expecting to see was this gray cross sliding sideways on the screen at different spots near the middle, but they switched that up for different folks.

What they found out was that the older you get, the more you might not notice new stuff popping up when you busy looking at something else – just like what Graham and Burke said. They even put numbers on it, talking about every 10 years getting older could make you 1.3 times more likely to miss seeing new things. They also noticed that the more the unexpected thing was away from where you looking, the less likely you are to see it, backing up what Most and his colleagues found.

But check this, the way age messes with not noticing"

A vasectomy is considered successful if the sample is azoospermic (zero sperm of any kind found). Some define success as when rare/occasional non-motile sperm are observed (fewer than 100,000 per millilitre). Others advocate obtaining a second semen analysis to verify the counts are not increasing (as can happen with re-canalization) and others still may perform a repeat vasectomy for this situation.","Semen check-up -- When we talk 'bout sperm count, or better say sperm concentration so it ain't mixed up with total sperm count, it's all about how many sperm in a man's nut. Total sperm count mean you take that sperm count and multiply it by the volume. Now, if you got over 15 million sperm per milliliter, that’s straight, the WHO said that back in 2010.

The resolution was jointly proposed by 138 member states and introduced by the Italian ambassador, Vieri Traxler, in memory of the organization's origins in the Battle of Solferino. An agreement with the Swiss government signed on 19 March 1993, affirmed the already long-standing policy of full independence of the Committee from any possible interference by Switzerland. The agreement protects the full sanctity of all ICRC property in Switzerland including its headquarters and archive, grants members and staff legal immunity, exempts the ICRC from all taxes and fees, guarantees the protected and duty-free transfer of goods, services, and money, provides the ICRC with secure communication privileges at the same level as foreign embassies, and simplifies Committee travel in and out of Switzerland.","International Committee of the Red Cross -- Back on October 16, 1990, the UN General Assembly decided to let the ICRC hang out at its assembly sessions and sub-committee meetings as an observer, making it the first private group to get that spot.

do universal life policies have a cash value,do universal life policies got a cash value?,"Universal life insurance -- Universal life insurance (often shortened to UL) is a type of cash value life insurance, sold primarily in the United States of America. Under the terms of the policy, the excess of premium payments above the current cost of insurance is credited to the cash value of the policy. The cash value is credited each month with interest, and the policy is debited each month by a cost of insurance (COI) charge, as well as any other policy charges and fees drawn from the cash value, even if no premium payment is made that month. Interest credited to the account is determined by the insurer, but has a contractual minimum rate (often 2%). When an earnings rate is pegged to a financial index such as a stock, bond or other interest rate index, the policy is an ``Indexed Universal Life'' contract. These types of policies offer the advantage of guaranteed level premiums throughout the insured's lifetime at substantially lower premium cost than an equivalent whole life policy at first; the cost of insurance is always increasing as found on the cost index table (usually p. 3 of a contract). This not only allows for easy comparison of costs between carriers, but also works well in irrevocable life insurance trusts (ILIT's) since cash is of no consequence.","Universal life insurance -- Aight, so check this out. Universal life insurance, or UL for short, is this kind of life insurance where you got cash value, right? It's mostly something folks get in the States. Here's how it goes down: when you pay more on your premium than what the current insurance cost is, that extra cash gets added to your policy's cash value. Every month, they gonna add some interest to this cash value, but they also gonna take out some money for the insurance cost (that's the COI), plus any other fees or charges. Now, even if you ain't pay your premium that month, they still pulling these costs from your cash value.

The interest they add, that's set by the insurance company, but they gotta give you at least the minimum rate they promised in the contract, usually around 2%. Now, if your earnings rate is tied to some financial index, like stocks or bonds, then you dealing with what they call an Indexed Universal Life policy.

These kind of policies are sweet because they let you lock in the cost of your premiums for your whole life, and usually, they start out cheaper than if you went with a whole life policy. But don't get it twisted—the cost of"
do you have to pay to be on judge judy,do you gotta pay to be on Judge Judy?,"Judge Judy -- Both the plaintiff(s) and the defendant(s) also receive an appearance fee. The appearance fee amount has varied as between different litigants of the show: certain litigants have reported receiving a $500 appearance fee while others have reported receiving $100, and others $250. In addition to the appearance fee amount, litigants are paid $35 a day by the show. The litigants' stay lasts for the number of days that the show does taping for that week, which is two or three days. In addition, the airfare (or other means of travel) and hotel expenses of the litigants and their witnesses are covered by the show, and the experience is generally treated as an all-expense-paid vacation outside of the actual court case. If there is an exchange of property, Sheindlin signs an order, and a sheriff or marshal oversees the exchange. Sheindlin sees only a half-page complaint and a defense response prior to the taping of the cases, sometimes only moments before. Most of the cases, not including any footage deleted to meet the time constraints of the show, usually last anywhere from twelve to forty-five minutes.","Yo, check it out, on Judge Judy, both the folks suing and the ones being sued get paid just for showing up. How much they get can vary—some might pocket $500, while others might only get $100 or maybe $250. Plus, they get $35 each day they're there filming, which usually takes about two or three days.

On top of that, the show covers their travel and hotel costs for them and their witnesses. So it's like a free mini-vacation, except they gotta deal with court stuff too.

Judge Judy herself only gets a quick look at a half-page complaint and what the defense says right before she tapes the cases, sometimes just moments ahead. Most of these cases run between twelve to forty-five minutes, not counting any parts that get cut to fit the show's time limit."

do they sell beer in grocery stores in new jersey,Do they be sellin' beer in grocery stores out in New Jersey?,"Alcohol laws of New Jersey -- In addition to granting local governments wide latitude over liquor sales, New Jersey law has some other unusual features. Corporations are limited to two retail distribution licenses, making it impractical for chain stores to sell alcoholic beverages; this restriction, in conjunction with municipal ordinances, severely limits supermarket and convenience store chains from selling beer as they do in many other states. State law treats drunk driving as a traffic offense rather than a crime, and permits individual municipalities to define the scope of underage drinking laws.","Alcohol laws in New Jersey -- New Jersey lets local governments have a lot of control over selling liquor, but there’s some other unique stuff too.

do both feet leave the ground when running,do both yo feet leave the ground when you runnin'?,"Running -- Running is a method of terrestrial locomotion allowing humans and other animals to move rapidly on foot. Running is a type of gait characterized by an aerial phase in which all feet are above the ground (though there are exceptions). This is in contrast to walking, where one foot is always in contact with the ground, the legs are kept mostly straight and the center of gravity vaults over the stance leg or legs in an inverted pendulum fashion. A characteristic feature of a running body from the viewpoint of spring-mass mechanics is that changes in kinetic and potential energy within a stride occur simultaneously, with energy storage accomplished by springy tendons and passive muscle elasticity. The term running can refer to any of a variety of speeds ranging from jogging to sprinting.","Running -- Running is a way folks and animals get around quick on their feet. It's a kind of movement where there's a moment when all feet are off the ground, unlike walking where at least one foot stays touching the ground.

is there a difference between ez pass and express e zpass,Is there a difference between EZ Pass and Express EZ Pass?,"E-ZPass -- Most E‐ZPass lanes are converted manual toll lanes and must have fairly low speed limits for safety reasons (between 5 and 15 miles per hour (8 and 24 km/h) is typical), so that E‐ZPass vehicles can merge safely with vehicles that stopped to pay a cash toll and, in some cases, to allow toll workers to safely cross the E‐ZPass lanes to reach booths accepting cash payments.

Explain that for me.,"Mixing (process engineering) -- In industrial process engineering, mixing is a unit operation that involves manipulation of a heterogeneous physical system with the intent to make it more homogeneous. Familiar examples include pumping of the water in a swimming pool to homogenize the water temperature, and the stirring of pancake batter to eliminate lumps (deagglomeration). Mixing is performed to allow heat and/or mass transfer to occur between one or more streams, components or phases. Modern industrial processing almost always involves some form of mixing. Some classes of chemical reactors are also mixers. With the right equipment, it is possible to mix a solid, liquid or gas into another solid, liquid or gas. A biofuel fermenter may require the mixing of microbes, gases and liquid medium for optimal yield; organic nitration requires concentrated (liquid) nitric and sulfuric acids to be mixed with a hydrophobic organic phase; production of pharmaceutical tablets requires blending of solid powders. The opposite of mixing is segregation. A classical example of segregation is the brazil nut effect.","Mixing (process engineering) -- In industrial process engineering, mixing be a unit operation where you manipulate a system with different parts to make it more uniform.

can you drop kick a field goal in nfl,can you drop kick a field goal in the NFL?,"Drop kick -- In 1934, the ball was made more pointed at the ends. The creation of the pointed football is generally credited to Shorty Ray, at the time a college football official and later the NFL's head of officiating. This made passing the ball easier, as was its intent, but made the drop kick obsolete, as the more pointed ball did not bounce up from the ground reliably. The drop kick was supplanted by the place kick, which cannot be attempted out of a formation generally used as a running or passing set. The drop kick remains in the rules, but is seldom seen, and rarely effective when attempted. In Canadian football the drop kick can be taken from any point on the field, unlike placekicks which must be attempted behind the line of scrimmage.","Drop kick -- Back in 1934, they changed the football to have more pointed ends. The dude we thank for that is Shorty Ray, who was a big deal in college football and later ran the officiating for the NFL. This tweak was supposed to make throwing the ball easier, and it did, but it also pretty much killed the drop kick since the pointed ball wouldn’t bounce right back up from the ground. So, folks moved on to using the place kick instead, which you can't really do from the usual running or passing setups.

After experimenting with unmanned balloons and flights with animals, the first balloon flight with humans aboard, a tethered flight, performed on or around October 15, 1783, by Jean-Francois Pilatre de Rozier who made at least one tethered flight from the yard of the Reveillon workshop in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. Later that same day, Pilatre de Rozier became the second human to ascend into the air, reaching an altitude of 26 m (85 ft), the length of the tether. The first free flight with human passengers was made a few weeks later, on November 21, 1783. King Louis XVI had originally decreed that condemned criminals would be the first pilots, but de Rozier, along with Marquis François d'Arlandes, petitioned successfully for the honor.

can alkenes have more than one double bond,can alkenes got multiple double bonds?,"Alkene -- In organic chemistry, an alkene is an unsaturated hydrocarbon that contains at least one carbon--carbon double bond. The words alkene and olefin are often used interchangeably (see nomenclature section below). Acyclic alkenes, with only one double bond and no other functional groups, known as mono-enes, form a homologous series of hydrocarbons with the general formula CH. Alkenes have two hydrogen atoms fewer than the corresponding alkane (with the same number of carbon atoms). The simplest alkene, ethylene (CH), with the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name ethene, is the organic compound produced on the largest scale industrially. Aromatic compounds are often drawn as cyclic alkenes, but their structure and properties are different and they are not considered to be alkenes.","Alkene -- In organic chemistry, an alkene is this type of hydrocarbon that ain't fully saturated and got at least one carbon-carbon double bond. Folks use the terms alkene and olefin like they the same thing (check out the nomenclature part later). Now, acyclic alkenes, which got just one double bond and no other special groups, are called mono-enes. These form a series of hydrocarbons that follow a general formula CH. Alkenes got two hydrogen atoms less than their alkane cousins with the same number of carbon atoms. The simplest one, ethylene (also known as ethene in the science world), is this organic compound they make a whole lot of in industry. Now, them aromatic compounds might look like cyclic alkenes, but they built different and got different vibes, so they ain't really considered alkenes."
is a section of dna recognized by a restriction endonuclease,is a part of DNA that a restriction enzyme recognize?,"Endonuclease -- Restriction enzymes are endonucleases from eubacteria and archaea that recognize a specific DNA sequence. The nucleotide sequence recognized for cleavage by a restriction enzyme is called the restriction site. Typically, a restriction site will be a palindromic sequence about four to six nucleotides long. Most restriction endonucleases cleave the DNA strand unevenly, leaving complementary single-stranded ends. These ends can reconnect through hybridization and are termed ``sticky ends''. Once paired, the phosphodiester bonds of the fragments can be joined by DNA ligase. There are hundreds of restriction endonucleases known, each attacking a different restriction site. The DNA fragments cleaved by the same endonuclease can be joined together regardless of the origin of the DNA. Such DNA is called recombinant DNA; DNA formed by the joining of genes into new combinations. Restriction endonucleases (restriction enzymes) are divided into three categories, Type I, Type II, and Type III, according to their mechanism of action. These enzymes are often used in genetic engineering to make recombinant DNA for introduction into bacterial, plant, or animal cells, as well as in synthetic biology.","Endonuclease -- Yo, so check it: restriction enzymes are these special kinda enzymes from bacteria and archaea that recognize a specific DNA sequence, right? They look for a certain spot on the DNA, called the restriction site, to cut. Usually, this spot is a palindrome and about four to six letters long. Most of the time, these enzymes cut the DNA uneven, leaving ends that kinda stick out and can stick back together. These sticky ends can link back up through hybridization, and then you can seal them up with something called DNA ligase.

There are a whole lot of different restriction enzymes, and each one targets a different spot. If you cut DNA with the same enzyme, you can mix and match pieces from different sources. When you do that, you get what's called recombinant DNA, which is just DNA that's been put together in new ways.

Restriction enzymes come in three types: Type I, Type II, and Type III, each working a bit differently. Folks use these enzymes a lot in genetic engineering, like when they wanna put new DNA into bacteria, plants, or animals, or mess with synthetic biology."

In 1916, Guy Fleming visited the park and after examining the current condition, pushed for preservation of the park and eventually became the District Superintendent for the Southern California State Park System. The Torrey Pines Lodge was completed in 1923 and a year later, more lands were added to the park. Now consisting of over 1,000 acres of cliffs, beach, and more, the park became open to the public.","Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve -- This spot used to be where the Kumeyaay folks lived.

is there a relationship between molecular weight and diffusion rate,do molecular weight affect how fast somethin' diffuse?,"Graham's law -- Graham's law states that the rate of diffusion or of effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molecular weight. Thus, if the molecular weight of one gas is four times that of another, it would diffuse through a porous plug or escape through a small pinhole in a vessel at half the rate of the other (heavier gases diffuse more slowly). A complete theoretical explanation of Graham's law was provided years later by the kinetic theory of gases. Graham's law provides a basis for separating isotopes by diffusion--a method that came to play a crucial role in the development of the atomic bomb.","Graham's law talk 'bout how fast gases move or escape through small openings, and it’s all tied to how heavy they are. The heavier the gas, the slower it moves. So, if one gas is four times heavier than another, it's gonna move through or escape half as fast. Later on, the kinetic theory of gases broke down why this happens. This law is also key for splitting up isotopes, which was real important in making the atomic bomb."

is being dismissed the same as being fired,Is gettin' dismissed the same as gettin' fired?,"Dismissal (employment) -- Dismissal (referred to informally as firing or sacking) is the termination of employment by an employer against the will of the employee. Though such a decision can be made by an employer for a variety of reasons, ranging from an economic downturn to performance-related problems on the part of the employee, being fired has a strong stigma in many cultures. To be dismissed, as opposed to quitting voluntarily (or being laid off), is often perceived as being the employee's fault. Finding new employment may often be difficult after being fired, particularly if there is a history of being fired from previous jobs, if the reason for firing is for some serious infraction, or the employee did not hold the job very long. Job seekers will often not mention jobs that they were fired from on their resumes; accordingly, unexplained gaps in employment are often regarded as a red flag.","Getting Fired -- When you get fired, that means your boss has decided to let you go and it ain't your choice. This can happen for all sorts of reasons, like the company ain't doing well or maybe they ain't happy with how you been working. Getting fired ain't look good, and folks often blame the person who lost their job. If you been fired, it might be tough to find another job, especially if you been fired before, did something real bad, or didn’t stay at that job long. When folks are looking for a new job, they usually don’t talk about the jobs they got fired from, and when they can’t explain gaps in their work history, that’s a warning sign to employers."

is st. patrick's day a holy day,"St. Patrick's Day, a holy day or somethin'?","Saint Patrick's Day -- Saint Patrick's feast day, as a kind of national day, was already being celebrated by the Irish in Europe in the ninth and tenth centuries. In later times, he became more and more widely seen as the patron of Ireland. Saint Patrick's feast day was finally placed on the universal liturgical calendar in the Catholic Church due to the influence of Waterford-born Franciscan scholar Luke Wadding in the early 1600s. Saint Patrick's Day thus became a holy day of obligation for Roman Catholics in Ireland. It is also a feast day in the Church of Ireland, which is part of the worldwide Anglican Communion. The church calendar avoids the observance of saints' feasts during certain solemnities, moving the saint's day to a time outside those periods. St Patrick's Day is occasionally affected by this requirement, when 17 March falls during Holy Week. This happened in 1940, when Saint Patrick's Day was observed on 3 April to avoid it coinciding with Palm Sunday, and again in 2008, where it was officially observed on 15 March. St Patrick's Day will not fall within Holy Week again until 2160. However, the popular festivities may still be held on 17 March or on a weekend near to the feast day.","Saint Patrick's Day -- Back in the day, like way back in the ninth and tenth centuries, folks were already celebrating Saint Patrick's feast day as a big deal, kinda like a national day for the Irish in Europe. Over time, Saint Patrick got even more props as the main man for Ireland. Thanks to Luke Wadding, a smart dude from Waterford and a Franciscan scholar, Saint Patrick's feast day got officially added to the Catholic Church’s calendar in the early 1600s. That made it a must-do holy day for Roman Catholics in Ireland. It’s also a special day for the Church of Ireland, which is connected worldwide with the Anglican Communion.

Now, the church calendar usually skips over saints' days when there's some major solemnities happening, so sometimes they gotta move Saint Patrick's Day out of those periods. For instance, in 1940, they had to celebrate it on 3 April instead of the usual 17 March 'cause it was too close to Palm Sunday, and the same shift happened in 2008 to 15 March. Saint Patrick's Day ain’t gonna bump into Holy Week again until 2160. But regardless of the official date, people still get down with the celebrations on 17 March"

do betta fish only fight other betta fish,do betta fish only scrap wit other betta fish,"Siamese fighting fish -- Males and females flare or puff out their gill covers (opercula) to appear more impressive, either to intimidate other rivals or as an act of courtship. Other reasons for flaring can include when they are intimidated by movement or change of scene in their environments. Both sexes display pale horizontal bars if stressed or frightened. However, such colour changes, common in females of any age, are rare in mature males due to their intensity of colour. Females often flare at other females, especially when setting up a pecking order. Flirting fish behave similarly, with vertical instead of horizontal stripes indicating a willingness and readiness to breed (females only). Betta splendens enjoy a decorated tank, being a territorial fish it is necessary to establish territory even when housed alone. They may set up a territory centered on a plant or rocky alcove, sometimes becoming highly possessive of it and aggressive toward trespassing rivals. This is the reason why when kept with other fish the minimum tank size should be 45 litres (about 10 gallons). Contrary to popular belief, bettas are compatible with many other species of aquarium fish. Given the proper parameters bettas will be known to only be aggressive towards smaller and slower fish than themselves such as guppies.","Siamese fighting fish, both the males and females, puff up they gills to look tough, either to scare off other fish or to show off for a mate. They might flare up when they get scared by something moving or changing around them too. Both the boys and girls get these light bars on them when they stressed or scared. Now, changing colors is normal for the ladies no matter their age, but it’s rare in grown males 'cause they usually got more vibrant colors. Females often puff up at other females too, especially when they tryna figure out who's boss. When it comes to flirting, the fish show different patterns, like vertical stripes to let others know they ready to mate, but that’s just the females.

Betta splendens like their space looking nice since they territorial. Even if they by themselves, they need to feel like they got their own spot, like around a plant or a little rocky spot, and they don’t play about it, getting all defensive if another fish comes by. That’s why if you got them with other fish, you need at least a 45-liter tank. People think bettas can’t chill with other fish, but that ain’t true. They usually only got beef with fish that are"

is cottage cheese the same as cheese curds,Is cottage cheese the same as cheese curds?,"Cottage cheese -- Curd size is the size of the chunks in the cottage cheese. The two major types of cottage cheese are small-curd, high-acid cheese made without rennet, and large-curd, low-acid cheese made with rennet. Rennet is a natural complex of enzymes that speeds curdling and keeps the curd that forms from breaking up. Adding rennet shortens the cheese-making process, resulting in a lower acid and larger curd cheese, and reduces the amount of curd poured off with leftover liquid (whey). Sometimes large-curd cottage cheese is called ``chunk style.''","Cottage cheese -- When we talkin' 'bout curd size, we talkin' 'bout how big the chunks in the cottage cheese be.

is a stop sign considered a traffic control device,Is a stop sign counted as a traffic control device?,"Stop sign -- Stop sign placement can pose an additional challenge to users. There is a tradeoff between the salient visual cues provided by increased limit line setback, and the crucial time that is lost in approaching the intersection from behind that line; being closer can provide a few additional seconds requisite for safe transit. However, common creeping into the intersection past the limit line causes drivers to lose the invaluable perspective of the visual acuity of lateral motion, crippling them to the more dangerous SAVT. This makes it very difficult to estimate the movement of oncoming traffic. As intersections are not engineered to be used this way, the traffic flow ideals have broken down when drivers consistently choose this method as the safer alternative. Stop signs are accompanied with a limit line, which has a mandatory setback distance which is often not less than 15 feet. While it may be negligence per se to prematurely pass the stop limit line, drivers may be unfairly denied sufficient time gap or opportunity to enter otherwise because of the through-traffic flow and speed; the inherent problem with this traffic control device. While stop signs are a relatively inexpensive method of traffic management, they can be expensive from perspective of the damage they cause users. Pricey but safer traffic signals, roundabouts, and traffic circles are alternatively used where traffic flow dictates it is inappropriate to use a stop sign. It is just as crucial for law enforcement to regulate traffic through-speed that is above the assured clear distance ahead ahead as it is to cite stop sign runners for this device to be a viable option.","Stop sign issues -- Where they put stop signs can make it hard for folks. There's this thing where if they set the line you gotta stop at further back, you see better, but then you lose time getting to the crossroads. If you're closer, you got a few extra seconds which helps crossing safely. But, folks tend to creep past that stop line, and that messes up their side view, making it tough to see cars coming from the sides, which is risky. This ain't how intersections should work, and when everybody starts doing this thinking it's safer, the whole traffic flow gets messed up.

Stop signs got this line you can't cross until you stop, and it's usually at least 15 feet back. If you cross it too soon, that's technically breaking the rule, but sometimes drivers do it cause they ain't given enough time to safely join the main traffic due to how fast the main traffic is flowing. This is a big issue with stop signs.

Even though stop signs ain't that expensive for controlling traffic, they can end up costing a lot cause of the accidents they can cause. In places where there's a lot of traffic, they might use traffic lights, roundabouts, or circles instead, cause a stop sign just"

does alternative minimum tax apply to capital gains,do alternative minimum tax hit capital gains?,"Alternative minimum tax -- Each year a taxpayer must calculate and then pay the greater of an alternative minimum tax (AMT) or regular tax. Effectively for high income earners who mitigate their tax position from the day-to-day income tax, an end-of-year consolidation of all taxable income is requested and submitted. This is then paid in arrears (from the normal payroll income tax) less any allowable deductions. For many taxpayers, the effective marginal tax rates are 0% (exemption), 26% (low bracket), 28% (high bracket), 32.5% (low bracket with exemption phase out), and 35% (high bracket with exemption phase out), with increasing taxable income as modified for AMT. As with regular federal income tax, rates and exemptions vary by filing status. The lower rate and the exemption are phased out above certain income levels at 25% of AMT income. A lower rate applies on long-term capital gains (and qualifying dividends).","Alright, check it. Every year, you gotta figure out which tax you owe more on: the alternative minimum tax (AMT) or the regular tax, right? So for folks who make a lot of money and manage to lower their taxes throughout the year, they gotta pull together all their taxable income when the year wraps up and report that. Then, they pay what they owe, minus the normal taxes taken out from their paycheck and any deductions they can claim.

Now, depending on how much you make, you might fall into different tax brackets with the AMT. The tax rates start at 0% if you're exempt, then it goes up to 26% or 28%, and if you're really pulling in cash but start losing some exemptions, it could hit you at 32.5% or even 35%.

Just like with the regular income tax, how much tax you pay and what exemptions you get depends on how you file—like single, married, whatever. And if you make a bunch, they start phasing out the lower rate and exemptions, taking away 25% of your AMT income over certain levels. Plus, there’s a lower tax rate for long-term capital gains and some dividends. Clear?"

is cognitive therapy the same as cognitive behavioural therapy,"Nah, they ain't exactly the same. Cognitive therapy mostly deals with ya thoughts and how they affect how you feel. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, or CBT, it takes it a step further by also working on ya behaviors too. So, it's like cognitive therapy but with an extra focus on changing actions too.","Cognitive therapy -- Cognitive therapy (CT) is a type of psychotherapy developed by American psychiatrist Aaron T. Beck. CT is one of the therapeutic approaches within the larger group of cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT) and was first expounded by Beck in the 1960s. Cognitive therapy is based on the cognitive model, which states that thoughts, feelings and behavior are all connected, and that individuals can move toward overcoming difficulties and meeting their goals by identifying and changing unhelpful or inaccurate thinking, problematic behavior, and distressing emotional responses. This involves the individual working collaboratively with the therapist to develop skills for testing and modifying beliefs, identifying distorted thinking, relating to others in different ways, and changing behaviors. A tailored cognitive case conceptualization is developed by the cognitive therapist as a roadmap to understand the individual's internal reality, select appropriate interventions and identify areas of distress.","Cognitive therapy, or CT for short, was created by this American psychiatrist named Aaron T. Beck. It's a part of these bigger therapy styles called cognitive behavioral therapies, or CBT. Beck started talking about it back in the 60s. The whole idea of CT is that your thoughts, feelings, and actions are all linked together. By figuring out and tweaking the thoughts that ain't helpful or right, and by addressing the behaviors and emotions that cause trouble, folks can start to handle their problems better and hit their goals.

When you work with a therapist in CT, it's all about teaming up to build skills that let you test and change your beliefs, recognize when your thinking is off, interact with others in new ways, and switch up how you act. The therapist helps put together a special plan that makes sense of what you're feeling on the inside, picks the right steps to take, and spots the things that stress you out."
