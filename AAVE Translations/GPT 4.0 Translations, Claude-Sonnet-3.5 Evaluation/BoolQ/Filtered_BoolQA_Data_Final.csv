1,do good samaritan laws protect those who help at an accident,do good samaritan laws got yo back if you help out at an accident?,True,"Good Samaritan law -- Good Samaritan laws offer legal protection to people who give reasonable assistance to those who are, or who they believe to be, injured, ill, in peril, or otherwise incapacitated. The protection is intended to reduce bystanders' hesitation to assist, for fear of being sued or prosecuted for unintentional injury or wrongful death. An example of such a law in common-law areas of Canada: a good Samaritan doctrine is a legal principle that prevents a rescuer who has voluntarily helped a victim in distress from being successfully sued for wrongdoing. Its purpose is to keep people from being reluctant to help a stranger in need for fear of legal repercussions should they make some mistake in treatment. By contrast, a duty to rescue law requires people to offer assistance and holds those who fail to do so liable.",True,"Good Samaritan law -- Good Samaritan laws give legal backup to folks who step up to help others who look hurt, sick, in danger, or can't help themselves.

For instance, up in Canada, the Good Samaritan rule is a legal thing that says if you willingly help someone in trouble, you can't be taken to court for messing up. It's all about making sure people don't hesitate to lend a hand to a stranger in need because they're scared of getting into legal trouble if they don't do everything perfect.

For example, the surface of a floor or table that prevents an object from falling. In this instance normal is used in the geometric sense and means perpendicular, as opposed the common language use of normal meaning common or expected. For example, a person standing still on flat ground is supported by a ground reaction force that consists of only a normal force. If the person stands on a slope and does not slide down it, then the total ground reaction force can be divided into two components: a normal force perpendicular to the ground and a frictional force parallel to the ground. In another common situation, if an object hits a surface with some speed, and the surface can withstand it, the normal force provides for a rapid deceleration, which will depend on the flexibility of the surface and the object.",False,"Normal force -- In mechanics, the normal force F n (\displaystyle F_(n)\ ) be that force from touching that be straight up against the surface where something be resting.

For real, if somebody just standing on flat ground, they held up by this force from the ground that’s all about that normal force. But if they on a hill chilling and they ain’t sliding down, then the force from the ground they feeling split into two parts: a normal force that’s straight up from the ground and a friction force that run right along the ground.

278,does puerto rico have to follow us laws,do Puerto Rico gotta follow US laws?,True,"Implications of Puerto Rico's current political status -- Constitutionally, Puerto Rico is subject to the Congress' plenary powers under the territorial clause of Article IV, sec. 3, of the U.S. Constitution. U.S. federal law applies to Puerto Rico, even though Puerto Rico is not a state of the American Union and their residents have no voting representation in the U.S. Congress. Because of the establishment of the Federal Relations Act of 1950, all federal laws that are ``not locally inapplicable'' are automatically the law of the land in Puerto Rico. Following the 1950 and 1952 legislation, only two district court decisions have held that a particular federal law, which does not specifically exclude or treat Puerto Rico differently, is inapplicable to Puerto Rico. The more recent decision was vacated on appeal. Efrén Rivera Ramos, Dean and Professor of Law at the University of Puerto Rico School of Law, clarified the meaning of plenary powers, explaining, ``The government of a state derives its powers from the people of the state, whereas the government of a territory owes its existence wholly to the United States. The Court thus seems to equate plenary power to exclusive power. The U.S. government could exert over the territory power that it could not exercise over the states.'' Ramos quotes Justice Harlan, writing in Grafton v. United States, 206 U.S. 333 (1907), ``The jurisdiction and authority of the United States over that territory (referring to the Philippines) and its inhabitants, for all legitimate purposes of government is paramount,''. Ramos then goes on to argue ``This power, however, is not absolute, for it is restrained by some then-undefined fundamental rights possessed by anyone subject to the authority of the U.S. government.''",True,"So, check it out, Puerto Rico's whole political setup is kinda unique. Constitutionally, Puerto Rico falls under the full control of the U.S. Congress because of this rule in the Constitution called the territorial clause. What this means is, even though Puerto Rico ain't a state and the folks there can't vote in the U.S. Congress, U.S. federal laws still apply over there. Back in 1950, this law called the Federal Relations Act made it so that all federal laws that fit with Puerto Rico’s situation automatically apply there.

Since this law kicked in during the 1950s, there have been only a couple of court cases where they decided a federal law didn't apply to Puerto Rico unless the law specifically said it didn't or treated Puerto Rico differently. The most recent case like that even got overturned.

Now, there's this law professor, Efrén Rivera Ramos, who’s been breaking down what these powers really mean. He says that while a state’s government gets its power from its people, a territory like Puerto Rico gets its powers from the United States. The courts seem to think this gives the U.S. government a lot of control, more than it would have over the states.

Interest credited to the account is determined by the insurer, but has a contractual minimum rate (often 2%). When an earnings rate is pegged to a financial index such as a stock, bond or other interest rate index, the policy is an ``Indexed Universal Life'' contract. These types of policies offer the advantage of guaranteed level premiums throughout the insured's lifetime at substantially lower premium cost than an equivalent whole life policy at first; the cost of insurance is always increasing as found on the cost index table (usually p. 3 of a contract).

If there is an exchange of property, Sheindlin signs an order, and a sheriff or marshal oversees the exchange.

579,can a gas mix into a liquid explain,Can gas mix into a liquid? Explain that for me.,True,"Mixing (process engineering) -- In industrial process engineering, mixing is a unit operation that involves manipulation of a heterogeneous physical system with the intent to make it more homogeneous. Familiar examples include pumping of the water in a swimming pool to homogenize the water temperature, and the stirring of pancake batter to eliminate lumps (deagglomeration). Mixing is performed to allow heat and/or mass transfer to occur between one or more streams, components or phases. Modern industrial processing almost always involves some form of mixing. Some classes of chemical reactors are also mixers. With the right equipment, it is possible to mix a solid, liquid or gas into another solid, liquid or gas. A biofuel fermenter may require the mixing of microbes, gases and liquid medium for optimal yield; organic nitration requires concentrated (liquid) nitric and sulfuric acids to be mixed with a hydrophobic organic phase; production of pharmaceutical tablets requires blending of solid powders. The opposite of mixing is segregation. A classical example of segregation is the brazil nut effect.",True,"Mixing (process engineering) -- In industrial process engineering, mixing be a unit operation where you manipulate a system with different parts to make it more uniform. Some everyday examples include pumping water in a pool to even out the water temperature, and stirring pancake batter to get rid of lumps.

Some types of chemical reactors are mixers too. With the right tools, you can mix a solid, liquid, or gas into another solid, liquid, or gas. For instance, making biofuel might need mixing microbes, gases, and liquid so everything works right; making organic nitrates needs mixing concentrated (liquid) nitric and sulfuric acids with a hydrophobic organic phase; and making pharmaceutical tablets involves blending solid powders.

629,is a section of dna recognized by a restriction endonuclease,is a part of DNA that a restriction enzyme recognize?,True,"Endonuclease -- Restriction enzymes are endonucleases from eubacteria and archaea that recognize a specific DNA sequence. The nucleotide sequence recognized for cleavage by a restriction enzyme is called the restriction site. Typically, a restriction site will be a palindromic sequence about four to six nucleotides long. Most restriction endonucleases cleave the DNA strand unevenly, leaving complementary single-stranded ends. These ends can reconnect through hybridization and are termed ``sticky ends''. Once paired, the phosphodiester bonds of the fragments can be joined by DNA ligase. There are hundreds of restriction endonucleases known, each attacking a different restriction site. The DNA fragments cleaved by the same endonuclease can be joined together regardless of the origin of the DNA. Such DNA is called recombinant DNA; DNA formed by the joining of genes into new combinations. Restriction endonucleases (restriction enzymes) are divided into three categories, Type I, Type II, and Type III, according to their mechanism of action. These enzymes are often used in genetic engineering to make recombinant DNA for introduction into bacterial, plant, or animal cells, as well as in synthetic biology.",True,"Endonuclease -- Yo, so check it: restriction enzymes are these special kinda enzymes from bacteria and archaea that recognize a specific DNA sequence, right? They look for a certain spot on the DNA, called the restriction site, to cut. Usually, this spot is a palindrome and about four to six letters long. Most of the time, these enzymes cut the DNA uneven, leaving ends that kinda stick out and can stick back together. These sticky ends can link back up through hybridization, and then you can seal them up with something called DNA ligase.

There are a whole lot of different restriction enzymes, and each one targets a different spot. If you cut DNA with the same enzyme, you can mix and match pieces from different sources. When you do that, you get what's called recombinant DNA, which is just DNA that's been put together in new ways.

Restriction enzymes come in three types: Type I, Type II, and Type III, each working a bit differently. Folks use these enzymes a lot in genetic engineering, like when they wanna put new DNA into bacteria, plants, or animals, or mess with synthetic biology.",True,1,1

703,does stefan's constant depend upon wavelength of radiation,do stefan's constant change with the wavelength of the radiation?,False,"Stefan–Boltzmann constant -- The Stefan--Boltzmann constant (also Stefan's constant), a physical constant denoted by the Greek letter σ (sigma), is the constant of proportionality in the Stefan--Boltzmann law: ``the total intensity radiated over all wavelengths increases as the temperature increases'', of a black body which is proportional to the fourth power of the thermodynamic temperature. The theory of thermal radiation lays down the theory of quantum mechanics, by using physics to relate to molecular, atomic and sub-atomic levels. Slovenian physicist Josef Stefan formulated the constant in 1879, and it was later derived in 1884 by Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann. The equation can also be derived from Planck's law, by integrating over all wavelengths at a given temperature, which will represent a small flat black body box. ``The amount of thermal radiation emitted increases rapidly and the principal frequency of the radiation becomes higher with increasing temperatures''. The Stefan--Boltzmann constant can be used to measure the amount of heat that is emitted by a blackbody, which absorbs all of the radiant energy that hits it, and will emit all the radiant energy. Furthermore, the Stefan--Boltzmann constant allows for temperature (K) to be converted to units for intensity (W m), which is power per unit area.",False,"Stefan-Boltzmann constant -- This right here is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, also called Stefan's constant, and it's a serious constant in physics represented by the Greek letter σ (sigma). It's all about this rule called the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which tells us that as things heat up, they start shining brighter and across all kinds of light wavelengths. Basically, the heat glow of a black body is linked to the temperature raised to the fourth power.

Now, this concept comes from thermal radiation theory, which digs into how heat acts on the super small scale, like with atoms and sub-atomic particles, using quantum mechanics. Back in the day, in 1879, this dude from Slovenia named Josef Stefan came up with this constant. Then, a few years later in 1884, another brainy guy, Ludwig Boltzmann from Austria, went ahead and derived it. You can also pull this equation from something called Planck's law if you integrate over all possible wavelengths at a certain temp, imagining you got this tiny, flat, black box.

One such subarea would be the Maya area covering the Yucatán Peninsula, all of Guatemala and Belize, and parts of the states of Chiapas and Tabasco, where Mayan languages have been highly predominant. In Chiapas and on the Guatemalan Pacific coast, speakers of Mixe--Zoquean languages were initially dominant, but with the spread of Mayan languages they were pushed out on the fringes of the areas, or into isolated pockets, and the same was the case for speakers of Xinca and Lenca which were probably also spoken in the area in the preclassic period. Another linguistic area is Oaxaca, which is dominated by speakers of Oto-Manguean languages; here Mixe--Zoque speakers were also gradually displaced by speakers of Zapotecan languages, as well as by speakers of Huave and Tequistlatecan languages. Oaxaca is the most linguistically diverse area of Mesoamerica and its 36,820 square miles (95,400 km) contain at least 100 mutually unintelligible linguistic variants. The subarea commonly called Central Mexico, covering valleys and mountainous areas surrounding the Valley of Mexico, originally contained mostly northern Oto-Manguean (Oto-Pamean) languages; however, beginning in the late classic these languages were gradually displaced by Nahuatl, which is now the predominant indigenous language of the area. The Western area was inhabited mostly by speakers of Purépecha and some Uto-Aztecan languages such as Huichol and Nahuatl. The Northern Rim area has been inhabited by semi-nomadic speakers of Uto-Aztecan languages (the Tepiman and Cora-Huichol groups) as well as Pamean (Oto-Mangue), and other languages that are now extinct. The Gulf area is traditionally the home of speakers of Totonacan languages in the northern and central area and Mixe--Zoque in the southern area. However, the northern gulf area became home to the speakers of Huastec in the preclassic period, and the southern area fell under Nahuan dominance in the post-classic period. The Central American area was originally inhabited by speakers of Misumalpan, Jicaquean and Chibchan languages which became subject to dominance and linguistic influence by Maya speaking groups in the classic period. Guerrero does not really constitute its own linguistic area; however, it has been influenced from the Oaxacan, Western or central Mexican area at different times of its history.",False,"Aight, so check it out, we talkin' 'bout Mesoamerican languages, right?

767,is a stop sign considered a traffic control device,Is a stop sign counted as a traffic control device?,True,"Stop sign -- Stop sign placement can pose an additional challenge to users. There is a tradeoff between the salient visual cues provided by increased limit line setback, and the crucial time that is lost in approaching the intersection from behind that line; being closer can provide a few additional seconds requisite for safe transit. However, common creeping into the intersection past the limit line causes drivers to lose the invaluable perspective of the visual acuity of lateral motion, crippling them to the more dangerous SAVT. This makes it very difficult to estimate the movement of oncoming traffic. As intersections are not engineered to be used this way, the traffic flow ideals have broken down when drivers consistently choose this method as the safer alternative. Stop signs are accompanied with a limit line, which has a mandatory setback distance which is often not less than 15 feet. While it may be negligence per se to prematurely pass the stop limit line, drivers may be unfairly denied sufficient time gap or opportunity to enter otherwise because of the through-traffic flow and speed; the inherent problem with this traffic control device. While stop signs are a relatively inexpensive method of traffic management, they can be expensive from perspective of the damage they cause users. Pricey but safer traffic signals, roundabouts, and traffic circles are alternatively used where traffic flow dictates it is inappropriate to use a stop sign. It is just as crucial for law enforcement to regulate traffic through-speed that is above the assured clear distance ahead ahead as it is to cite stop sign runners for this device to be a viable option.",True,"Stop sign issues -- Where they put stop signs can make it hard for folks. There's this thing where if they set the line you gotta stop at further back, you see better, but then you lose time getting to the crossroads. If you're closer, you got a few extra seconds which helps crossing safely. But, folks tend to creep past that stop line, and that messes up their side view, making it tough to see cars coming from the sides, which is risky. This ain't how intersections should work, and when everybody starts doing this thinking it's safer, the whole traffic flow gets messed up.

Stop signs got this line you can't cross until you stop, and it's usually at least 15 feet back. If you cross it too soon, that's technically breaking the rule, but sometimes drivers do it cause they ain't given enough time to safely join the main traffic due to how fast the main traffic is flowing. This is a big issue with stop signs.

Even though stop signs ain't that expensive for controlling traffic, they can end up costing a lot cause of the accidents they can cause. In places where there's a lot of traffic, they might use traffic lights, roundabouts, or circles instead, cause a stop sign just",True,1,1

769,does alternative minimum tax apply to capital gains,do alternative minimum tax hit capital gains?,True,"Alternative minimum tax -- Each year a taxpayer must calculate and then pay the greater of an alternative minimum tax (AMT) or regular tax. Effectively for high income earners who mitigate their tax position from the day-to-day income tax, an end-of-year consolidation of all taxable income is requested and submitted. This is then paid in arrears (from the normal payroll income tax) less any allowable deductions. For many taxpayers, the effective marginal tax rates are 0% (exemption), 26% (low bracket), 28% (high bracket), 32.5% (low bracket with exemption phase out), and 35% (high bracket with exemption phase out), with increasing taxable income as modified for AMT. As with regular federal income tax, rates and exemptions vary by filing status. The lower rate and the exemption are phased out above certain income levels at 25% of AMT income. A lower rate applies on long-term capital gains (and qualifying dividends).",True,"Alright, check it. Every year, you gotta figure out which tax you owe more on: the alternative minimum tax (AMT) or the regular tax, right? So for folks who make a lot of money and manage to lower their taxes throughout the year, they gotta pull together all their taxable income when the year wraps up and report that. Then, they pay what they owe, minus the normal taxes taken out from their paycheck and any deductions they can claim.

Now, depending on how much you make, you might fall into different tax brackets with the AMT. The tax rates start at 0% if you're exempt, then it goes up to 26% or 28%, and if you're really pulling in cash but start losing some exemptions, it could hit you at 32.5% or even 35%.

Just like with the regular income tax, how much tax you pay and what exemptions you get depends on how you file—like single, married, whatever.
