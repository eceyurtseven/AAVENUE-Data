do good samaritan laws protect those who help at an accident,do good samaritan laws got yo back if you help out at an accident?,True,"Good Samaritan law -- Good Samaritan laws offer legal protection to people who give reasonable assistance to those who are, or who they believe to be, injured, ill, in peril, or otherwise incapacitated. The protection is intended to reduce bystanders' hesitation to assist, for fear of being sued or prosecuted for unintentional injury or wrongful death. An example of such a law in common-law areas of Canada: a good Samaritan doctrine is a legal principle that prevents a rescuer who has voluntarily helped a victim in distress from being successfully sued for wrongdoing. Its purpose is to keep people from being reluctant to help a stranger in need for fear of legal repercussions should they make some mistake in treatment. By contrast, a duty to rescue law requires people to offer assistance and holds those who fail to do so liable.",True,"Good Samaritan law -- Good Samaritan laws give legal backup to folks who step up to help others who look hurt, sick, in danger, or can't help themselves.

For instance, up in Canada, the Good Samaritan rule is a legal thing that says if you willingly help someone in trouble, you can't be taken to court for messing up. It's all about making sure people don't hesitate to lend a hand to a stranger in need because they're scared of getting into legal trouble if they don't do everything perfect. On the flip side, a duty to rescue law says you gotta help out, and if you don't, you could be held responsible.",True,

can you have a right and left bundle branch block,Can you have both a right and left bundle branch block at the same time?,True,"Bundle branch block -- A bundle branch block can be diagnosed when the duration of the QRS complex on the ECG exceeds 120 ms. A right bundle branch block typically causes prolongation of the last part of the QRS complex, and may shift the heart's electrical axis slightly to the right. The ECG will show a terminal R wave in lead V1 and a slurred S wave in lead I. Left bundle branch block widens the entire QRS, and in most cases shifts the heart's electrical axis to the left. The ECG will show a QS or rS complex in lead V1 and a monophasic R wave in lead I. Another normal finding with bundle branch block is appropriate T wave discordance. In other words, the T wave will be deflected opposite the terminal deflection of the QRS complex. Bundle branch block, especially left bundle branch block, can lead to cardiac dyssynchrony. The simultaneous occurrence of left and right bundle branch block leads to total AV block.",False,"Bundle branch block -- Aight, when we talkin' 'bout a bundle branch block, docs can spot it if the QRS complex on the ECG take longer than 120 ms.

The ECG gonna show either a QS or rS complex in lead V1 and a straight R wave in lead I. Another thing that's normal with a bundle branch block is what they call appropriate T wave discordance. That means the T wave goes the opposite direction of the last swing of the QRS complex. Bundle branch block, especially the left side one, can mess up the heart's timing.

does age have any influence on attentional ability or inattentional blindness,Do age affect how well folks pay attention or not notice things?,True,"Inattentional blindness -- In a 2015 study, Cary Stothart, Walter Boot, and Daniel Simons attempted to replicate and extend the findings from both Graham and Burke's 2011 study and Steven Most and colleague's 2000 study on Amazon Mechanical Turk using a sample of 515 participants that varied in age. In this study, participants were tasked with counting the number of times a number of white moving objects crossed the vertical midpoint of a display while ignoring a number of black moving objects. The unexpected object in this case was a gray cross that moved horizontally across the display at various distances from the vertical midpoint (this was manipulated between participants). Overall, they found that inattentional blindness susceptibility increases with age, which replicates the finding from Graham and Burke. In fact, they found that every 10 years of age was associated with a 1.3 fold increase in the probability of displaying inattentional blindness. They also found that the probability of inattentional blindness increases as the distance between the observer's focus of attention and the unexpected object increases, which replicates the finding from Most and colleagues. However, they also found that the relationship that age has with inattentional blindness does not change as a function of the unexpected object's distance from the focus of attention, suggesting that useful field of view does not mediate the relationship between age and inattentional blindness.",True,"Inattentional blindness study in 2015 -- So, Cary Stothart, Walter Boot, and Daniel Simons was tryna see if they could get the same results as them studies from Graham and Burke in 2011 and Steven Most and them from back in 2000.

Now, the thing they wasn't expecting to see was this gray cross sliding sideways on the screen at different spots near the middle, but they switched that up for different folks.

What they found out was that the older you get, the more you might not notice new stuff popping up when you busy looking at something else – just like what Graham and Burke said. They even put numbers on it, talking about every 10 years getting older could make you 1.3 times more likely to miss seeing new things. They also noticed that the more the unexpected thing was away from where you looking, the less likely you are to see it, backing up what Most and his colleagues found.

the visual cliff is a device for studying,the visual cliff is a tool for lookin' into,True,"Visual cliff -- The visual cliff apparatus was created by psychologists Eleanor J. Gibson and Richard D. Walk at Cornell University to investigate depth perception in human and animal species. This apparatus allowed them to experimentally adjust the optical and tactical stimuli associated with a simulated cliff while protecting the subjects from injury. The visual cliff consists of a sheet of Plexiglas that covers a cloth with a high-contrast checkerboard pattern. On one side the cloth is placed immediately beneath the Plexiglas, and on the other, it is dropped about 4 feet below. Since the Plexiglas supports the weight of the infant this is a visual cliff rather than a drop off. Using a visual cliff apparatus, Gibson and Walk examined possible perceptual differences at crawling age between human infants born preterm and human infants born at term without documented visual or motor impairments.",True,"Visual cliff -- So, the visual cliff setup was cooked up by psychologists Eleanor J. Gibson and Richard D. Walk over at Cornell University, and they did this to check out how both humans and animals see depth. What they did was they made this device where they could mess around with what you see and feel that makes it seem like there's a cliff, but they made sure nobody would actually get hurt. This setup got a Plexiglas sheet covering a checkered cloth that's got bold patterns. On one side, the cloth is right under the Plexiglas, and on the other side, it's about 4 feet down. Now, since the Plexiglas can hold up a baby's weight, we're talking about a fake cliff, not a real drop. Gibson and Walk used this visual cliff thing to see if there's any difference in how babies who were born early and those who weren't, and who don't have any known issues with their eyes or movement, understand depth when they start crawling.",True,

is the graviton part of the standard model,Do gravitons fit in with the Standard Model?,False,"Graviton -- Most theories containing gravitons suffer from severe problems. Attempts to extend the Standard Model or other quantum field theories by adding gravitons run into serious theoretical difficulties at energies close to or above the Planck scale. This is because of infinities arising due to quantum effects; technically, gravitation is not renormalizable. Since classical general relativity and quantum mechanics seem to be incompatible at such energies, from a theoretical point of view, this situation is not tenable. One possible solution is to replace particles with strings. String theories are quantum theories of gravity in the sense that they reduce to classical general relativity plus field theory at low energies, but are fully quantum mechanical, contain a graviton, and are thought to be mathematically consistent.",False,"Look, most theories that got gravitons in 'em tend to have big issues. When folks try to mix gravitons into the Standard Model or other quantum field theories, they hit major trouble when they get to energies near or above the Planck scale.

Since the classic general relativity and quantum mechanics don't mesh well at these levels, from a theory standpoint, it just ain't working. One idea that might work is switching out particles for strings.

are the normal force and force of gravity always equal,do the normal force and force of gravity always match up?,False,"Normal force -- In mechanics, the normal force F n (\displaystyle F_(n)\ ) is that component of the contact force that is perpendicular to the surface that an object contacts. For example, the surface of a floor or table that prevents an object from falling. In this instance normal is used in the geometric sense and means perpendicular, as opposed the common language use of normal meaning common or expected. For example, a person standing still on flat ground is supported by a ground reaction force that consists of only a normal force. If the person stands on a slope and does not slide down it, then the total ground reaction force can be divided into two components: a normal force perpendicular to the ground and a frictional force parallel to the ground. In another common situation, if an object hits a surface with some speed, and the surface can withstand it, the normal force provides for a rapid deceleration, which will depend on the flexibility of the surface and the object.",False,"Normal force -- In mechanics, the normal force F n (\displaystyle F_(n)\ ) be that force from touching that be straight up against the surface where something be resting.

For real, if somebody just standing on flat ground, they held up by this force from the ground that’s all about that normal force. But if they on a hill chilling and they ain’t sliding down, then the force from the ground they feeling split into two parts: a normal force that’s straight up from the ground and a friction force that run right along the ground.

does canada's worst driver lose their license,do Canada's worst driver lose they license?,False,"Canada's Worst Driver -- In each season, eight drivers and their nominators-- Canada's Worst Driver 11 had nine drivers; more on this later-- are enrolled at the Driver Rehabilitation Centre where they compete in challenges designed to improve their driving skills, in an effort to not be named Canada's Worst Driver. In the first challenge, the contestants begin at a location about an hour's drive from the Driver Rehabilitation Centre. Following the directions that are given, each contestant must drive to the Driver Rehabilitation Centre where, upon arriving, the driver's license of each contestant is confiscated (for the first two seasons, their car keys were confiscated instead). The first episode concludes with an obstacle course or assessment challenge, meant to evaluate the skills of each driver. The series is well known for its obstacle course challenges. Contestants must routinely maneuver their cars through tight spaces with less than an inch of clearance on either side. To show that the challenge can be done without hitting obstacles by an average driver, host Andrew Younghusband, himself an average driver, performs each challenge before any contestant attempts said challenge. At the end of each episode, starting with the second episode of each season, each contestant meets with Andrew and a panel of four experts for an evaluation of his or her performance. After all remaining contestants are interviewed, the experts and Andrew deliberate on which contestant and nominator pair have improved enough to graduate from the Driver Rehabilitation Centre. The driver who has graduated is eliminated from the competition and is sent home with his or her license returned to him or her. Typically, the contestants drive off with their nominators in the car that they used to arrive at the Driver Rehabilitation Centre. During the series, the experts also reserve the right to not graduate anyone during an episode or to graduate multiple contestants at the same time. The experts may also choose to expel any contestant prematurely who does not show any incentive to learn, who they believe should not continue driving or who can not continue the rehabilitation program often for medical or legal reasons. In this particular instance, certain contestants are eliminated from the competition and their licenses are returned and they are given a ride home by their nominators. However, a prematurely expelled contestant or contestant who refuses to continue may still be considered for the title, as was the case in Canada's Worst Driver Ever, in which Dale Pitton was expelled in the second-to-last episode, only to be brought back for the trophy presentation. In extreme cases, the experts may contact the relevant Ministry of Transport and request that a driver's license be put up for review, if they believe that a contestant is medically unfit to continue driving. To date, this has happened only twice, in Canada's Worst Driver 4 with Donna Hicks and Canada's Worst Driver Ever with Dale. The elimination process continues until only three contestants remain (the original intent was for two contestants to remain, but due to the first season containing an episode in which no one graduated, there were three; every subsequent season has had three finalists). Those three finalists are then given the final challenge, which is typically a three-in-a-car forward-backward slalom within a certain time limit, followed by the Mega Challenge, an obstacle course with elements of almost every previous challenge (the standard transmission balancing challenge, among others, is not part of the Mega Challenge, but every challenge that is practical to include does get included), as well as a driving examination through the busy streets of a major urban centre in Canada near the Driver Rehabilitation Centre (since season seven, the road test has been in Hamilton, Ontario). Based on these three challenges, the experts determine which among the three is Canada's Worst Driver. With the exception of the eighth season, in which both Kevin Simmons and Flora Wang were named Canada's Worst Driver, the contestant who fared the second-worst is deemed to not have graduated from the Driver Rehabilitation Centre, while the contestant who fared the third-worst is considered a graduate (with the exception of the eleventh season, in which, despite faring the third-worst, Sholom Hoffman failed to graduate). Unlike other versions of the Worst Driver series around the world, where being eliminated early is rewarded with a new car while the Worst Driver has their car destroyed, Canada's Worst Driver awards no prizes aside from a trophy for being named the worst, as the point of the show is to educate rather than entertain.",False,"Canada's Worst Driver -- So check it, every season, they pick like eight (sometimes nine) folks who really can't drive and their homies who nominated them, and they all head to the Driver Rehabilitation Centre. They tryna get better at driving so they ain’t called Canada's Worst Driver. The first thing they gotta do is drive there from about an hour away, following the directions given. When they pull up, they gotta hand over their driver's licenses (used to be car keys in the first couple seasons). They wrap up the first episode with some tough driving test or obstacle course to see where their skills at.

This show's big on those wild obstacle challenges, man. They be driving through tight spots with barely any room to breathe. The host, Andrew Younghusband, who's just an average driver, he does each challenge first to show it's doable. After the second episode, contestants gotta meet up with Andrew and four experts to talk about how they did. Depending on how they've improved, they might graduate from the program, which means they out of the competition and get their license back. They dip out in the same whip they came in.

Throughout the show, these experts might decide to not let anyone graduate in an episode,",True,

is polygamy legal in any state in the united states,Is polygamy legal in any state in the U.S.?,False,"Polygamy in North America -- Polygamy is the act or condition of a person marrying another person while still being lawfully married to another spouse.

Polygamy was outlawed federally by the Edmunds Act, and there are laws against the practice in all 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto Rico. Because state laws exist, polygamy is not actively prosecuted at the federal level, but the practice is considered ``against public policy'' and, accordingly, the U.S. government won't recognize bigamous marriages for immigration purposes (that is, would not allow one of the spouses to petition for immigration benefits for the other), even if they are legal in the country where bigamous marriage was celebrated.

was mercury used as a cure for syphilis,Did they use mercury to treat syphilis back in the day?,True,"History of syphilis -- Mercury was a common, long-standing treatment for syphilis, and its use as such has been suggested to date back to The Canon of Medicine (1025) by the Persian physician Ibn Sina (Avicenna); although this is only possible if syphilis existed in the Old World prior to Columbus (see § Origin). One of the first supporters of mercury treatment was Paracelsus because it had positive effects on the Arabic treatment of leprosy, which was thought to be a disease related to syphilis. Giorgio Sommariva of Verona is recorded to have used mercury to treat syphilis in 1496, and is often recognized as the first physician to have done so, although he may not have been a physician. During the sixteenth century, mercury was administered to syphilitic patients in various ways, including by rubbing it on the skin, by applying a plaster, and by mouth. A ``Fumigation'' method of administering mercury was also used, in which mercury was vaporized over a fire and the patients were exposed to the resulting steam, either by being placed in a bottomless seat over the hot coals, or by having their entire bodies except for the head enclosed in a box (called a ``tabernacle'') that received the steam. The goal of mercury treatment was to cause the patient to salivate, which was thought to expel the disease. Unpleasant side effects of mercury treatment included gum ulcers and loose teeth. Mercury continued to be used in syphilis treatment for centuries; an 1869 article by TJ Walker discussed administering mercury by injection for this purpose.",True,"So check it, back in the day, folks used mercury to treat syphilis, right?

One of the first to big up mercury for syphilis was this guy Paracelsus. He peeped that mercury helped with leprosy, which folks thought was kinda like syphilis. Then, in 1496, this dude named Giorgio Sommariva from Verona started using mercury to cure syphilis, making him one of the first to do it, even though folks ain't sure if he was a real doctor.

During the 1500s, they had all sorts of ways to use mercury on folks with syphilis. They'd rub it on the skin, slap on a plaster, or even have folks swallow it. They even had this wild method called Fumigation, where they'd vaporize mercury over a fire, and patients would sit over it or get boxed up, except for their heads, to breathe in the steam.

does prime minister have to be an mp,do da prime minister gotta be a MP?,False,"Prime Minister of the United Kingdom -- The office is not established by any statute or constitutional document but exists only by long-established convention, which stipulates that the monarch must appoint as Prime Minister the person most likely to command the confidence of the House of Commons; this individual is typically the leader of the political party or coalition of parties that holds the largest number of seats in that chamber. The position of Prime Minister was not created; it evolved slowly and erratically over three hundred years due to numerous acts of Parliament, political developments, and accidents of history. The office is therefore best understood from a historical perspective. The origins of the position are found in constitutional changes that occurred during the Revolutionary Settlement (1688--1720) and the resulting shift of political power from the Sovereign to Parliament. Although the Sovereign was not stripped of the ancient prerogative powers and legally remained the head of government, politically it gradually became necessary for him or her to govern through a Prime Minister who could command a majority in Parliament.",True,"Prime Minister of the United Kingdom -- Ain't no official law or document set up this position; it's all about tradition. The queen or king gotta choose someone to be the Prime Minister who they think can get the most love from the House of Commons; usually, it's whoever leading the party with the most seats. This whole role of Prime Minister ain't just pop up overnight; it took like 300 years to form, mixing in all kinds of laws, political moves, and just random historical events. To really get it, you gotta look back at the history. The gig started getting its shape back during the Revolutionary Settlement between 1688 and 1720 when power started shifting from the king or queen to Parliament. Even though the king or queen was still technically in charge, politically, they had to start working through a Prime Minister who could hold down a majority in Parliament.",True,

does puerto rico have to follow us laws,do Puerto Rico gotta follow US laws?,True,"Implications of Puerto Rico's current political status -- Constitutionally, Puerto Rico is subject to the Congress' plenary powers under the territorial clause of Article IV, sec. 3, of the U.S. Constitution. U.S. federal law applies to Puerto Rico, even though Puerto Rico is not a state of the American Union and their residents have no voting representation in the U.S. Congress. Because of the establishment of the Federal Relations Act of 1950, all federal laws that are ``not locally inapplicable'' are automatically the law of the land in Puerto Rico. Following the 1950 and 1952 legislation, only two district court decisions have held that a particular federal law, which does not specifically exclude or treat Puerto Rico differently, is inapplicable to Puerto Rico. The more recent decision was vacated on appeal. Efrén Rivera Ramos, Dean and Professor of Law at the University of Puerto Rico School of Law, clarified the meaning of plenary powers, explaining, ``The government of a state derives its powers from the people of the state, whereas the government of a territory owes its existence wholly to the United States. The Court thus seems to equate plenary power to exclusive power. The U.S. government could exert over the territory power that it could not exercise over the states.'' Ramos quotes Justice Harlan, writing in Grafton v. United States, 206 U.S. 333 (1907), ``The jurisdiction and authority of the United States over that territory (referring to the Philippines) and its inhabitants, for all legitimate purposes of government is paramount,''. Ramos then goes on to argue ``This power, however, is not absolute, for it is restrained by some then-undefined fundamental rights possessed by anyone subject to the authority of the U.S. government.''",True,"So, check it out, Puerto Rico's whole political setup is kinda unique. Constitutionally, Puerto Rico falls under the full control of the U.S. Congress because of this rule in the Constitution called the territorial clause. What this means is, even though Puerto Rico ain't a state and the folks there can't vote in the U.S. Congress, U.S. federal laws still apply over there. Back in 1950, this law called the Federal Relations Act made it so that all federal laws that fit with Puerto Rico’s situation automatically apply there.

Since this law kicked in during the 1950s, there have been only a couple of court cases where they decided a federal law didn't apply to Puerto Rico unless the law specifically said it didn't or treated Puerto Rico differently. The most recent case like that even got overturned.

Now, there's this law professor, Efrén Rivera Ramos, who’s been breaking down what these powers really mean. He says that while a state’s government gets its power from its people, a territory like Puerto Rico gets its powers from the United States. The courts seem to think this gives the U.S. government a lot of control, more than it would have over the states.

These types of policies offer the advantage of guaranteed level premiums throughout the insured's lifetime at substantially lower premium cost than an equivalent whole life policy at first; the cost of insurance is always increasing as found on the cost index table (usually p. 3 of a contract).

does canada's prime minister hold a seat in the house of commons,Do Canada's Prime Minister be sittin' in the House of Commons?,False,"House of Commons of Canada -- Though it does not formally elect the prime minister, the House of Commons indirectly controls the premiership. By convention, the prime minister is answerable to, and must maintain the support of, the House of Commons. Thus, whenever the office of prime minister falls vacant, the governor general has the duty of appointing the person most likely to command the support of the House--normally the leader of the largest party in the lower house, although the system allows a coalition of two or more parties. This has not happened in the Canadian federal parliament, but has occurred in Canadian provinces. The leader of the second-largest party (or in the case of a coalition, the largest party out of government) usually becomes the Leader of the Official Opposition. Moreover, the prime minister is, by unwritten convention, a member of the House of Commons, rather than of the Senate. Only two prime ministers governed from the Senate: Sir John Abbott (1891--1892) and Sir Mackenzie Bowell (1894--1896).

Sometimes, though, they might need a group of parties to team up. This ain’t really happened on the federal level in Canada, but it’s gone down in the provinces. The leader of the next biggest party, or the biggest party not in the government if there's a coalition, ends up being the Leader of the Official Opposition. Also, it’s kinda an unwritten rule that the prime minister should be part of the House of Commons and not the Senate. Only two PMs ever ran things from the Senate: Sir John Abbott and Sir Mackenzie Bowell, and that was only 'cause they took over after a PM died, without having been elected.",True,

In addition, the airfare (or other means of travel) and hotel expenses of the litigants and their witnesses are covered by the show, and the experience is generally treated as an all-expense-paid vacation outside of the actual court case. If there is an exchange of property, Sheindlin signs an order, and a sheriff or marshal oversees the exchange.

can you remove venom glands from a snake,can you take out a snake's venom glands?,True,"Venomoid -- A venomoid is a venomous snake that has undergone a surgical procedure to remove or inhibit the production of snake venom. This procedure has been used for venomous snakes kept as pets or used in public demonstrations in order to remove the risk of injury or death when handled. The removal of venom glands or fangs of exhibited animals may be by surgery or simple mutilation; some or all of these procedures have been considered illegal and unethical.

As such, a saltwater pool is not actually chlorine-free; it simply utilizes added salt and a chlorine generator instead of direct addition of chlorine.",False,"Salt water chlorination -- Aight, so salt water chlorination is this method where they use salt that's dissolved in water (like 2,500 to 6,000 ppm) as a way to keep the chlorination system stocked up. The device that does the work, called a chlorine generator (or you might hear it called salt cell, salt generator, salt chlorinator, or SWG), uses a process called electrolysis. This happens when the salt (NaCl) is dissolved, and it produces hypochlorous acid (HClO) and sodium hypochlorite (NaClO). These are the cleaning agents that folks typically use in swimming pools. So, even though it’s called a saltwater pool, it ain’t free of chlorine; it just uses added salt and a chlorine generator instead of directly tossing in chlorine.",False,

The words alkene and olefin are often used interchangeably (see nomenclature section below). Acyclic alkenes, with only one double bond and no other functional groups, known as mono-enes, form a homologous series of hydrocarbons with the general formula CH. Alkenes have two hydrogen atoms fewer than the corresponding alkane (with the same number of carbon atoms). The simplest alkene, ethylene (CH), with the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name ethene, is the organic compound produced on the largest scale industrially.

is a section of dna recognized by a restriction endonuclease,is a part of DNA that a restriction enzyme recognize?,True,"Endonuclease -- Restriction enzymes are endonucleases from eubacteria and archaea that recognize a specific DNA sequence. The nucleotide sequence recognized for cleavage by a restriction enzyme is called the restriction site. Typically, a restriction site will be a palindromic sequence about four to six nucleotides long. Most restriction endonucleases cleave the DNA strand unevenly, leaving complementary single-stranded ends. These ends can reconnect through hybridization and are termed ``sticky ends''. Once paired, the phosphodiester bonds of the fragments can be joined by DNA ligase. There are hundreds of restriction endonucleases known, each attacking a different restriction site. The DNA fragments cleaved by the same endonuclease can be joined together regardless of the origin of the DNA. Such DNA is called recombinant DNA; DNA formed by the joining of genes into new combinations. Restriction endonucleases (restriction enzymes) are divided into three categories, Type I, Type II, and Type III, according to their mechanism of action. These enzymes are often used in genetic engineering to make recombinant DNA for introduction into bacterial, plant, or animal cells, as well as in synthetic biology.",True,"Endonuclease -- Yo, so check it: restriction enzymes are these special kinda enzymes from bacteria and archaea that recognize a specific DNA sequence, right? They look for a certain spot on the DNA, called the restriction site, to cut. Usually, this spot is a palindrome and about four to six letters long. Most of the time, these enzymes cut the DNA uneven, leaving ends that kinda stick out and can stick back together. These sticky ends can link back up through hybridization, and then you can seal them up with something called DNA ligase.

There are a whole lot of different restriction enzymes, and each one targets a different spot. If you cut DNA with the same enzyme, you can mix and match pieces from different sources. When you do that, you get what's called recombinant DNA, which is just DNA that's been put together in new ways.

Restriction enzymes come in three types: Type I, Type II, and Type III, each working a bit differently. Folks use these enzymes a lot in genetic engineering, like when they wanna put new DNA into bacteria, plants, or animals, or mess with synthetic biology.",True,

is st. patrick's day a holy day,"St. Patrick's Day, a holy day or somethin'?",True,"Saint Patrick's Day -- Saint Patrick's feast day, as a kind of national day, was already being celebrated by the Irish in Europe in the ninth and tenth centuries. In later times, he became more and more widely seen as the patron of Ireland. Saint Patrick's feast day was finally placed on the universal liturgical calendar in the Catholic Church due to the influence of Waterford-born Franciscan scholar Luke Wadding in the early 1600s. Saint Patrick's Day thus became a holy day of obligation for Roman Catholics in Ireland. It is also a feast day in the Church of Ireland, which is part of the worldwide Anglican Communion. The church calendar avoids the observance of saints' feasts during certain solemnities, moving the saint's day to a time outside those periods. St Patrick's Day is occasionally affected by this requirement, when 17 March falls during Holy Week. This happened in 1940, when Saint Patrick's Day was observed on 3 April to avoid it coinciding with Palm Sunday, and again in 2008, where it was officially observed on 15 March. St Patrick's Day will not fall within Holy Week again until 2160.

Thanks to Luke Wadding, a smart dude from Waterford and a Franciscan scholar, Saint Patrick's feast day got officially added to the Catholic Church’s calendar in the early 1600s. That made it a must-do holy day for Roman Catholics in Ireland. It’s also a special day for the Church of Ireland, which is connected worldwide with the Anglican Communion.

Now, the church calendar usually skips over saints' days when there's some major solemnities happening, so sometimes they gotta move Saint Patrick's Day out of those periods. For instance, in 1940, they had to celebrate it on 3 April instead of the usual 17 March 'cause it was too close to Palm Sunday, and the same shift happened in 2008 to 15 March. Saint Patrick's Day ain’t gonna bump into Holy Week again until 2160. But regardless of the official date, people still get down with the celebrations on 17 March",True,

Betta splendens enjoy a decorated tank, being a territorial fish it is necessary to establish territory even when housed alone.

does stefan's constant depend upon wavelength of radiation,do stefan's constant change with the wavelength of the radiation?,False,"Stefan–Boltzmann constant -- The Stefan--Boltzmann constant (also Stefan's constant), a physical constant denoted by the Greek letter σ (sigma), is the constant of proportionality in the Stefan--Boltzmann law: ``the total intensity radiated over all wavelengths increases as the temperature increases'', of a black body which is proportional to the fourth power of the thermodynamic temperature. The theory of thermal radiation lays down the theory of quantum mechanics, by using physics to relate to molecular, atomic and sub-atomic levels. Slovenian physicist Josef Stefan formulated the constant in 1879, and it was later derived in 1884 by Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann. The equation can also be derived from Planck's law, by integrating over all wavelengths at a given temperature, which will represent a small flat black body box. ``The amount of thermal radiation emitted increases rapidly and the principal frequency of the radiation becomes higher with increasing temperatures''. The Stefan--Boltzmann constant can be used to measure the amount of heat that is emitted by a blackbody, which absorbs all of the radiant energy that hits it, and will emit all the radiant energy. Furthermore, the Stefan--Boltzmann constant allows for temperature (K) to be converted to units for intensity (W m), which is power per unit area.",False,"Stefan-Boltzmann constant -- This right here is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, also called Stefan's constant, and it's a serious constant in physics represented by the Greek letter σ (sigma).

Basically, the heat glow of a black body is linked to the temperature raised to the fourth power.

Now, this concept comes from thermal radiation theory, which digs into how heat acts on the super small scale, like with atoms and sub-atomic particles, using quantum mechanics. Back in the day, in 1879, this dude from Slovenia named Josef Stefan came up with this constant. Then, a few years later in 1884, another brainy guy, Ludwig Boltzmann from Austria, went ahead and derived it. You can also pull this equation from something called Planck's law if you integrate over all possible wavelengths at a certain temp, imagining you got this tiny, flat, black box.

Another linguistic area is Oaxaca, which is dominated by speakers of Oto-Manguean languages; here Mixe--Zoque speakers were also gradually displaced by speakers of Zapotecan languages, as well as by speakers of Huave and Tequistlatecan languages. Oaxaca is the most linguistically diverse area of Mesoamerica and its 36,820 square miles (95,400 km) contain at least 100 mutually unintelligible linguistic variants. The subarea commonly called Central Mexico, covering valleys and mountainous areas surrounding the Valley of Mexico, originally contained mostly northern Oto-Manguean (Oto-Pamean) languages; however, beginning in the late classic these languages were gradually displaced by Nahuatl, which is now the predominant indigenous language of the area. The Western area was inhabited mostly by speakers of Purépecha and some Uto-Aztecan languages such as Huichol and Nahuatl. The Northern Rim area has been inhabited by semi-nomadic speakers of Uto-Aztecan languages (the Tepiman and Cora-Huichol groups) as well as Pamean (Oto-Mangue), and other languages that are now extinct. The Gulf area is traditionally the home of speakers of Totonacan languages in the northern and central area and Mixe--Zoque in the southern area. However, the northern gulf area became home to the speakers of Huastec in the preclassic period, and the southern area fell under Nahuan dominance in the post-classic period. The Central American area was originally inhabited by speakers of Misumalpan, Jicaquean and Chibchan languages which became subject to dominance and linguistic influence by Maya speaking groups in the classic period. Guerrero does not really constitute its own linguistic area; however, it has been influenced from the Oaxacan, Western or central Mexican area at different times of its history.",False,"Aight, so check it out, we talkin' 'bout Mesoamerican languages, right? Mesoamerica got these smaller spots where languages really mixed up heavy, or where some language families got real big. Like, take the Maya area – we talkin' 'bout the Yucatán Peninsula, all up in Guatemala and Belize, and bits of Chiapas and Tabasco. Mayan languages ruled the roost there. But down in Chiapas and on the Guatemalan Pacific coast, folks first spoke Mixe--Zoquean languages, but then the Mayan languages spread and kinda pushed the others to the side or into little isolated areas. Same thing happened with the Xinca and Lenca languages back in the day.

Then there's Oaxaca, right? This place is full-up with folks speaking Oto-Manguean languages. But again, Mixe--Zoque speakers got moved over time by folks speaking Zapotecan languages, plus some speaking Huave and Tequistlatecan. Oaxaca's like a language party, man – it's got over 100 different types of speak that don't even understand each other, all in 36,820 square miles!

the international monetary fund was formed to provide for the short-term flow of money,the international monetary fund was set up to handle the short-term flow of money,True,"Global financial system -- An important component of the Bretton Woods agreements was the creation of two new international financial institutions, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). Collectively referred to as the Bretton Woods institutions, they became operational in 1947 and 1946 respectively. The IMF was established to support the monetary system by facilitating cooperation on international monetary issues, providing advisory and technical assistance to members, and offering emergency lending to nations experiencing repeated difficulties restoring the balance of payments equilibrium. Members would contribute funds to a pool according to their share of gross world product, from which emergency loans could be issued. Member states were authorized and encouraged to employ capital controls as necessary to manage payments imbalances and meet pegging targets, but prohibited from relying on IMF financing to cover particularly short-term capital hemorrhages. While the IMF was instituted to guide members and provide a short-term financing window for recurrent balance of payments deficits, the IBRD was established to serve as a type of financial intermediary for channeling global capital toward long-term investment opportunities and postwar reconstruction projects. The creation of these organizations was a crucial milestone in the evolution of the international financial architecture, and some economists consider it the most significant achievement of multilateral cooperation following World War II. Since the establishment of the International Development Association (IDA) in 1960, the IBRD and IDA are together known as the World Bank. While the IBRD lends to middle-income developing countries, the IDA extends the Bank's lending program by offering concessional loans and grants to the world's poorest nations.",True,"Global financial system -- So check it, right after the Bretton Woods agreements, they set up two big money institutions, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). People usually call 'em the Bretton Woods institutions. They started doing their thing in 1947 and 1946. The IMF was all about keeping the money system smooth, helping countries work together on money matters, giving advice, and stepping in with cash when countries kept running into money troubles. Countries had to put money into a big pot based on how big they were on the global market, and that money could be used for emergency loans.

Now, these member countries could use some controls on their capital to handle payment issues and hit their targets, but they couldn't just use IMF money for quick fixes when they were bleeding cash short-term. While the IMF was there to guide and help with short-term money problems, the IBRD was like a middleman, pushing global capital towards long-term investments and helping rebuild stuff after the war. Setting up these organizations was a key point in building up the international financial system, and some smart folks think it was the biggest thing to come out of countries working together after World War II.

is a stop sign considered a traffic control device,Is a stop sign counted as a traffic control device?,True,"Stop sign -- Stop sign placement can pose an additional challenge to users. There is a tradeoff between the salient visual cues provided by increased limit line setback, and the crucial time that is lost in approaching the intersection from behind that line; being closer can provide a few additional seconds requisite for safe transit. However, common creeping into the intersection past the limit line causes drivers to lose the invaluable perspective of the visual acuity of lateral motion, crippling them to the more dangerous SAVT. This makes it very difficult to estimate the movement of oncoming traffic. As intersections are not engineered to be used this way, the traffic flow ideals have broken down when drivers consistently choose this method as the safer alternative. Stop signs are accompanied with a limit line, which has a mandatory setback distance which is often not less than 15 feet. While it may be negligence per se to prematurely pass the stop limit line, drivers may be unfairly denied sufficient time gap or opportunity to enter otherwise because of the through-traffic flow and speed; the inherent problem with this traffic control device. While stop signs are a relatively inexpensive method of traffic management, they can be expensive from perspective of the damage they cause users. Pricey but safer traffic signals, roundabouts, and traffic circles are alternatively used where traffic flow dictates it is inappropriate to use a stop sign. It is just as crucial for law enforcement to regulate traffic through-speed that is above the assured clear distance ahead ahead as it is to cite stop sign runners for this device to be a viable option.",True,"Stop sign issues -- Where they put stop signs can make it hard for folks. There's this thing where if they set the line you gotta stop at further back, you see better, but then you lose time getting to the crossroads. If you're closer, you got a few extra seconds which helps crossing safely. But, folks tend to creep past that stop line, and that messes up their side view, making it tough to see cars coming from the sides, which is risky. This ain't how intersections should work, and when everybody starts doing this thinking it's safer, the whole traffic flow gets messed up.

Stop signs got this line you can't cross until you stop, and it's usually at least 15 feet back. If you cross it too soon, that's technically breaking the rule, but sometimes drivers do it cause they ain't given enough time to safely join the main traffic due to how fast the main traffic is flowing. This is a big issue with stop signs.

Even though stop signs ain't that expensive for controlling traffic, they can end up costing a lot cause of the accidents they can cause. In places where there's a lot of traffic, they might use traffic lights, roundabouts, or circles instead, cause a stop sign just",True,

does alternative minimum tax apply to capital gains,do alternative minimum tax hit capital gains?,True,"Alternative minimum tax -- Each year a taxpayer must calculate and then pay the greater of an alternative minimum tax (AMT) or regular tax. Effectively for high income earners who mitigate their tax position from the day-to-day income tax, an end-of-year consolidation of all taxable income is requested and submitted. This is then paid in arrears (from the normal payroll income tax) less any allowable deductions. For many taxpayers, the effective marginal tax rates are 0% (exemption), 26% (low bracket), 28% (high bracket), 32.5% (low bracket with exemption phase out), and 35% (high bracket with exemption phase out), with increasing taxable income as modified for AMT. As with regular federal income tax, rates and exemptions vary by filing status. The lower rate and the exemption are phased out above certain income levels at 25% of AMT income. A lower rate applies on long-term capital gains (and qualifying dividends).",True,"Alright, check it. Every year, you gotta figure out which tax you owe more on: the alternative minimum tax (AMT) or the regular tax, right? So for folks who make a lot of money and manage to lower their taxes throughout the year, they gotta pull together all their taxable income when the year wraps up and report that. Then, they pay what they owe, minus the normal taxes taken out from their paycheck and any deductions they can claim.

Now, depending on how much you make, you might fall into different tax brackets with the AMT. The tax rates start at 0% if you're exempt, then it goes up to 26% or 28%, and if you're really pulling in cash but start losing some exemptions, it could hit you at 32.5% or even 35%.

Just like with the regular income tax, how much tax you pay and what exemptions you get depends on how you file—like single, married, whatever. And if you make a bunch, they start phasing out the lower rate and exemptions, taking away 25% of your AMT income over certain levels. Plus, there’s a lower tax rate for long-term capital gains and some dividends. Clear?",False,

Cognitive therapy is based on the cognitive model, which states that thoughts, feelings and behavior are all connected, and that individuals can move toward overcoming difficulties and meeting their goals by identifying and changing unhelpful or inaccurate thinking, problematic behavior, and distressing emotional responses. This involves the individual working collaboratively with the therapist to develop skills for testing and modifying beliefs, identifying distorted thinking, relating to others in different ways, and changing behaviors.

can a catholic receive communion in an episcopal church,Can a Catholic get communion at an Episcopal church?,False,"Closed communion -- The Catholic Church distinguishes between Churches whose celebration of the Eucharist, as well as holy orders, it recognizes as valid and those of other Christian communities.

The Catholic Church does not ordinarily allow a Catholic to receive communion in a Protestant church, since it does not consider Protestant ministers to be priests ordained by bishops in a line of valid succession from the apostles, although Lutherans, Moravians, and Anglicans teach that they ordain their clergy in lines of apostolic succession. It applies this rule also to the Anglican Communion, pursuant to Apostolicae curae, a position that the Church of England disputed in Saepius officio.",False,"Closed communion -- So here’s how it goes down in the Catholic Church: They got a list of churches they cool with when it comes to how they do the Eucharist and who they got as ministers.

do supreme court rulings apply to all states,Do Supreme Court rulings apply to erry state?,True,"Supremacy Clause -- The Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution (Article VI, Clause 2) establishes that the Constitution, federal laws made pursuant to it, and treaties made under its authority, constitute the supreme law of the land. It provides that state courts are bound by the supreme law; in case of conflict between federal and state law, the federal law must be applied. Even state constitutions are subordinate to federal law. In essence, it is a conflict-of-laws rule specifying that certain federal acts take priority over any state acts that conflict with federal law. In this respect, the Supremacy Clause follows the lead of Article XIII of the Articles of Confederation, which provided that ``Every State shall abide by the determination of the United States in Congress Assembled, on all questions which by this confederation are submitted to them.'' A constitutional provision announcing the supremacy of federal law, the Supremacy Clause assumes the underlying priority of federal authority, at least when that authority is expressed in the Constitution itself.

This whole idea started back with Article XIII of the Articles of Confederation, which was like “Every State gotta listen to what the United States in Congress Assembled decides on stuff that this confederation covers.” The Supremacy Clause is all about putting federal law first, showing that federal power is the main thing when it’s spelled out in the Constitution.

is a defibrillator used to restart the heart,Do a defibrillator be used to restart the heart?,False,"Defibrillation -- As devices that can quickly produce dramatic improvements in patient health, defibrillators are often depicted in movies, television, video games and other fictional media. Their function, however, is often exaggerated, with the defibrillator inducing a sudden, violent jerk or convulsion by the patient; in reality, although the muscles may contract, such dramatic patient presentation is rare. Similarly, medical providers are often depicted defibrillating patients with a ``flat-line'' ECG rhythm (also known as asystole). This is not normal medical practice, as the heart cannot be restarted by the defibrillator itself. Only the cardiac arrest rhythms ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia are normally defibrillated. The purpose of defibrillation is to depolarize the entire heart all at once so that it is synchronized, in the hope that it will resume beating normally. Someone who is already in asystole cannot be helped by electrical means, and usually needs urgent CPR and intravenous medication. There are also several heart rhythms that can be ``shocked'' when the patient is not in cardiac arrest, such as supraventricular tachycardia and ventricular tachycardia that produces a pulse; this more-complicated procedure is known as cardioversion, not defibrillation.",False,"Defibrillators — These devices can make a big difference real quick for folks who sick.

Defibrillators ain't made to bring someone back from being flat-lined. They only work right for certain types of heart issues like ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. Defibrillation’s main job is to get the heart’s rhythm right again, hoping it starts to beat proper after that.

If someone’s heart has stopped (asystole), zapping them ain’t gonna do nothing. They need CPR and medicine, stat.

can we get indian citizenship for us born child,,False,"Indian nationality law -- In response to persistent demands for dual citizenship, particularly from the diaspora in North America and other developed countries, the Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) scheme was introduced by amending The Citizenship Act, 1955 in August 2005. The scheme was launched during the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas convention in Hyderabad in 2006. Indian authorities have interpreted the law to mean a person cannot have a second country's passport simultaneously with an Indian one -- even in the case of a child who is claimed by another country as a citizen of that country, and who may be required by the laws of the other country to use one of its passports for foreign travel (such as a child born in the United States or in Australia to Indian parents), and the Indian courts have given the executive branch wide discretion over this matter. Therefore, Overseas Citizenship of India is not an actual citizenship of India and thus, does not amount to dual citizenship or dual nationality or anyone no longer to use Indian IDs after OCI. Moreover, the OCI card is not a substitute for an Indian visa and therefore, the passport which displays the lifetime visa must be carried by OCI holders while travelling to India. OCI Cards are now being printed without the lifelong ``U'' Visa Sticker (which is normally pasted on the applicant's passport). The proof of lifelong visa will be just the OCI Card which will have ``Life Time Visa'' printed on it. The OCI Card will be valid with any Valid Passport. However, countries may consider the OCI as dual citizenship: for example, the UK government considers that, for purposes of the British Nationality Act 1981, ``OCI is considered to be citizenship of another State''.",False,"Indian nationality law -- 'Cause folks kept askin' for dual citizenship, 'specially them livin' in North America and other rich places, India came up with this Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) by changin' The Citizenship Act, 1955 back in August 2005. They started this whole thing at the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas convention in Hyderabad in 2006. Indian folks say the law means you can't hold a passport from another country at the same time as an Indian one -- even if it's about a kid claimed by another country as its citizen, who might need to use that country's passport to travel abroad (like a kid born in the U.S. or Australia to Indian parents). And Indian courts let the government call the shots on this. So, this Overseas Citizenship of India ain't really being an Indian citizen and don't let you have dual citizenship or dual nationality, nor keep usin' Indian IDs after gettin' OCI.

can us supreme court justice be removed from office,,True,"Supreme Court of the United States -- Since the founding of the republic, there has been a tension between the practice of judicial review and the democratic ideals of egalitarianism, self-government, self-determination and freedom of conscience. At one pole are those who view the Federal Judiciary and especially the Supreme Court as being ``the most separated and least checked of all branches of government.'' Indeed, federal judges and justices on the Supreme Court are not required to stand for election by virtue of their tenure ``during good behavior,'' and their pay may ``not be diminished'' while they hold their position (Section 1 of Article Three). Though subject to the process of impeachment, only one Justice has ever been impeached and no Supreme Court Justice has been removed from office. At the other pole are those who view the judiciary as the least dangerous branch, with little ability to resist the exhortations of the other branches of government. The Supreme Court, it is noted, cannot directly enforce its rulings; instead, it relies on respect for the Constitution and for the law for adherence to its judgments. One notable instance of nonacquiescence came in 1832, when the state of Georgia ignored the Supreme Court's decision in Worcester v. Georgia. President Andrew Jackson, who sided with the Georgia courts, is supposed to have remarked, ``John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it!''; however, this alleged quotation has been disputed. Some state governments in the South also resisted the desegregation of public schools after the 1954 judgment Brown v. Board of Education.
