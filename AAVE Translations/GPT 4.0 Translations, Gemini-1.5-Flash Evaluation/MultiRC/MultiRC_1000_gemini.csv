The passage doesn't mention that Pakistan didn't earn merit for the visit. The passage states that the CIA and Secret Service were against the visit because it would put the President at risk. 

Here's why:

* The passage states the CIA and Secret Service were ""dead against it"" for security reasons. 
*  It never mentions Pakistan's lack of merit as a reason for opposing the visit.

The passage focuses on the perceived security risks of a visit to Pakistan, not on Pakistan's lack of merit for the visit."

"While this process moved along, diplomacy continued its rounds. Direct pressure on the Taliban had proved unsuccessful. As one NSC staff note put it, ""Under the Taliban, Afghanistan is not so much a state sponsor of terrorism as it is a state sponsored by terrorists."" In early 2000, the United States began a high-level effort to persuade Pakistan to use its influence over the Taliban. In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. Such a visit was coveted by Musharraf, partly as a sign of his government's legitimacy. He told the two envoys that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on  Bin Laden. They left, however, reporting to Washington that Pakistan was unlikely in fact to do anything,"" given what it sees as the benefits of Taliban control of Afghanistan."" President Clinton was scheduled to travel to India. The State Department felt that he should not visit India without also visiting Pakistan. The Secret Service and the CIA, however, warned in the strongest terms that visiting Pakistan would risk the President's life. Counterterrorism officials also argued that Pakistan had not done enough to merit a presidential visit. But President Clinton insisted on including Pakistan in the itinerary for his trip to South Asia. His one-day stopover on March 25, 2000, was the first time a U.S. president had been there since 1969. At his meeting with Musharraf and others, President Clinton concentrated on tensions between Pakistan and India and the dangers of nuclear proliferation, but also discussed  Bin Laden. President Clinton told us that when he pulled Musharraf aside for a brief, one-on-one meeting, he pleaded with the general for help regarding  Bin Laden.""

The meeting between Karl Inderfurth, Michael Sheehan and General Musharraf happened in January 2000.
2. President Clinton visited Pakistan on March 25, 2000.
3. The time between January and March is roughly 2-3 months.

Therefore, the answer is **0** (false).","The answer is **0** (false).

Here's why:

* The paragraph states the meeting between Inderfurth, Sheehan, and Musharraf happened in **January 2000**.
* It then mentions President Clinton was ""about to head to India"", which implies the visit was imminent. 
* The paragraph *does not* state that President Clinton actually visited Pakistan during this time. 

Therefore, we cannot determine how many months passed between the meeting and any potential visit to Pakistan."

While the passage does mention Alexander III and Nicholas II vowing to avoid a similar fate, this is not the primary impact of Alexander II's death on the Russian political scene.  

The passage focuses on these key impacts:

* **Setback to Reform:**  Alexander II's death halted the reform movement.
* **Cancellation of Duma Plans:** Alexander III immediately discarded his father's plans for an elected parliament.
* **Return to Oppression:**  Alexander III reversed many of his father's reforms and instituted a period of harsh repression.
* **Delay of Constitutional Monarchy:**  The potential for a constitutional monarchy in Russia was delayed by decades.

The statement about Alexander III and Nicholas II's vows is mentioned but does not represent the central impact of Alexander II's assassination."

* **The Relief:** Calaveras Kate is relieved that the stranger doesn't shoot Jason, implying that Jason might have been in danger.

**Therefore, the answer is TRUE (1).**  The stranger who is relieved at the end is Reb Randall."

Here's why:

* **Jason Carberry** is explicitly against the stranger, challenging him to a shootout. 

While there is tension and potential for conflict with:

* **Rafael Moreno** - He picks a fight with the stranger, but it's not clear he's *against* him in a larger sense. 
* **Billy Buckett** -  He's a suspect, but we don't know if he's actively hostile. 

Therefore, only Jason is confirmed as being against the stranger.","The answer is **1**. 

Here's why:

* **Jason Carberry** was openly against the stranger, trying to duel him and being protective of Susan.
* **Calaveras Kate** was happy the stranger didn't shoot Jason, implying she was on Jason's side.
* **Rafael Moreno** started a fight with the stranger, clearly against him.

While the paragraph suggests some suspicion about Jason and Rafael, they haven't directly confronted the stranger as enemies yet. Billy Buckett is just a comedic distraction. 

Therefore, only **Jason Carberry** is explicitly hostile towards the stranger."

During the course of 1999, Atta and his group became ever more extreme and secretive, speaking only in Arabic to conceal the content of their conversations. 87 When the four core members of the Hamburg cell left Germany to journey to Afghanistan late that year, it seems unlikely that they already knew about the planes operation; no evidence connects them to al Qaeda before that time. Witnesses have attested, however, that their pronouncements reflected ample predisposition toward taking some action against the United States. In short, they fit the bill for  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM. Going to Afghanistan The available evidence indicates that in 1999, Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah decided to fight in Chechnya against the Russians. ","Zakariya Essabar, a Moroccan citizen, moved to Germany in February 1997 and to Hamburg in 1998, where he studied medical technology. Soon after moving to Hamburg, Essabar met Binalshibh and the others through a Turkish mosque. Essabar turned extremist fairly suddenly, probably in 1999, and reportedly pressured one acquaintance with physical force to become more religious, grow a beard, and compel his wife to convert to Islam. Essabar's parents were said to have made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle. Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, he would travel to Afghanistan to communicate the date for the attacks to the al Qaeda leadership. Mounir el Motassadeq, another Moroccan, came to Germany in 1993, moving to Hamburg two years later to study electrical engineering at theTechnical University. A witness has recalled Motassadeq saying that he would kill his entire family if his religious beliefs demanded it. One of Motassadeq's roommates recalls him referring to Hitler as a ""good man"" and organizing film sessions that included speeches by  Bin Laden. Motassadeq would help conceal the Hamburg group's trip to Afghanistan in late 1999.

"Lash is associate dean at the University of Southern California Law School. Johnson is a justice on California's Second District Court of Appeal. Lash and Johnson are co-chairs of the California Commission on Access to Justice. The full report can be viewed at (www.calbar.org). In her year-long odyssey through the California justice system, Katherine, a 35-year-old single mother with three children, experienced failure at every turn. Leaving her abusive husband, she moved into the only apartment she could afford, and soon discovered a broken toilet and non- working oven, rats and roaches, and a fourthfloor landing with no railing. She began withholding rent pending repairs her landlord refused to make, but then her Medi-Cal benefits were cut off when she could not provide rent receipts. She lost health care for her children and herself, although she is a borderline diabetic in need of medication and her children were suffering from rat bites. Katherine tried to seek help through the courts. Representing herself at an administrative hearing, she lost her appeal to restore Medi-Cal benefits because she did not have proper documentation of the rent account. When she went to a courthouse to file a complaint against her landlord, she found the process so confusing that she gave up and went home. According to ""The Path to Justice: A Five-Year Status Report on Access to Justice in California,"" prepared by the California Commission on Access to Justice, Katherine is just one of 4.6 million poor Californians whose basic civil legal needs -- often involving such critical needs as housing, health care, education, employment, safety and transportation -- are not being addressed. California has a critical dearth of legal services for the poor, and, as this report makes clear, it is imperative that the state join with the federal government and private funders to increase resources so that all Californians, regardless of income, have equal access to our justice system. Our justice system is predicated on the assumption that both parties will be represented by lawyers who act as gatekeepers and guides through a complex legal system that would otherwise be inaccessible to many of us. Unfortunately, the most vulnerable members of our society are the least able to afford legal services. California does have a strong network of legal aid organizations that try to help meet the needs of the poor, but there's just one legal aid lawyer available per 10,000 poor people. We may promise ""justice for all,"" but for those who can't afford a lawyer, that promise is often a lie.

While the lack of rent receipts contributed to Katherine's struggles, it's not the sole reason why the justice system is hard for poor folks. The passage highlights several other obstacles, including:

* **Lack of legal representation:** Katherine represents herself in court, highlighting the difficulty of navigating the system without legal expertise.
* **Complex and confusing procedures:** The passage mentions a ""messed up"" process at the courthouse, demonstrating the barriers created by complex legal procedures.
* **Systemic bias and inequities:** The story implies that the justice system may be biased against low-income individuals, as Katherine's challenges seem to stem from her poverty.

Therefore, the answer is **0 (false)**. The lack of rent receipts is just one factor, and not the primary reason why the justice system is difficult for poor people."

While the paragraph does mention the struggles of a low-income single mother navigating the justice system, the provided answer focuses on a lack of legal aid lawyers, which is not mentioned in the paragraph. The passage highlights other barriers, such as:

* **Complex legal processes:** Katherine found the process of filing a complaint against her landlord confusing.
* **Lack of resources:**  She couldn't afford to get her rent receipts, which led to her losing her Medi-Cal benefits.
* **Lack of legal representation:**  She had to represent herself at an administrative hearing, which resulted in her losing her appeal. 
* **Consequences of poverty:** She was forced to live in substandard housing and struggled to access essential services like healthcare.

Therefore, the provided answer is not supported by the paragraph, making it false."

Perhaps the terrorists stabbed the flight attendants to get a cockpit key, to force one of them to open the cockpit door, or to lure the captain or first officer out of the cockpit. Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way. At the same time or shortly thereafter, Atta-the only terrorist on board trained to fly a jet-would have moved to the cockpit from his business-class seat, possibly accompanied by Omari. As this was happening, passenger Daniel Lewin, who was seated in the row just behind Atta and Omari, was stabbed by one of the hijackers-probably Satam al Suqami, who was seated directly behind Lewin. Lewin had served four years as an officer in the Israeli military. He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him, not realizing that another was sitting behind him. The hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed Mace, pepper spray, or some other irritant in the first-class cabin, in order to force the passengers and flight attendants toward the rear of the plane. They claimed they had a bomb. About five minutes after the hijacking began, Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina, via an AT&T airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight. This was the first of several occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized that in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit crew. The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground. At 8:19, Ong reported:""The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class-and I think there's Mace-that we can't breathe-I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked."" She then told of the stabbings of the two flight attendants. At 8:21, one of the American employees receiving Ong's call in North Carolina, Nydia Gonzalez, alerted the American Airlines operations center in Fort Worth, Texas, reaching Craig Marquis, the manager on duty. Marquis soon realized this was an emergency and instructed the airline's dispatcher responsible for the flight to contact the cockpit.

The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground. At 8:19, Ong reported:""The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class-and I think there's Mace-that we can't breathe-I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked."" She then told of the stabbings of the two flight attendants. At 8:21, one of the American employees receiving Ong's call in North Carolina, Nydia Gonzalez, alerted the American Airlines operations center in Fort Worth, Texas, reaching Craig Marquis, the manager on duty. Marquis soon realized this was an emergency and instructed the airline's dispatcher responsible for the flight to contact the cockpit. At 8:23, the dispatcher tried unsuccessfully to contact the aircraft. ","We ain't sure how them hijackers got into the cockpit; FAA rules said them doors gotta stay closed and locked while flying.

At the same time or shortly thereafter, Atta-the only terrorist on board trained to fly a jet-would have moved to the cockpit from his business-class seat, possibly accompanied by Omari. As this was happening, passenger Daniel Lewin, who was seated in the row just behind Atta and Omari, was stabbed by one of the hijackers-probably Satam al Suqami, who was seated directly behind Lewin. Lewin had served four years as an officer in the Israeli military. He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him, not realizing that another was sitting behind him. The hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed Mace, pepper spray, or some other irritant in the first-class cabin, in order to force the passengers and flight attendants toward the rear of the plane. They claimed they had a bomb. About five minutes after the hijacking began, Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina, via an AT&T airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight. This was the first of several occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized that in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit crew. The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground. At 8:19, Ong reported:""The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class-and I think there's Mace-that we can't breathe-I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked."" She then told of the stabbings of the two flight attendants. At 8:21, one of the American employees receiving Ong's call in North Carolina, Nydia Gonzalez, alerted the American Airlines operations center in Fort Worth, Texas, reaching Craig Marquis, the manager on duty. Marquis soon realized this was an emergency and instructed the airline's dispatcher responsible for the flight to contact the cockpit. At 8:23, the dispatcher tried unsuccessfully to contact the aircraft. ","We ain't sure how dem hijackers got into the cockpit; FAA rules said dem doors gotta stay shut and locked while flying. Ong thought they forced they way in. Maybe them terrorists stabbed the flight attendants to grab a cockpit key, force one to open the door, or to get the captain or first officer out the cockpit. Or maybe the flight attendants was just in they way. Around the same time or right after, Atta—the only terrorist trained to fly a jet—probably headed to the cockpit from his business-class seat, maybe with Omari. While this was going down, passenger Daniel Lewin, sitting right behind Atta and Omari, got stabbed by one of the hijackers—probably Satam al Suqami, who was right behind Lewin. Lewin had done four years as an officer in the Israeli military. He might've tried to stop the hijackers in front of him, not knowing another was right behind him. The hijackers took control quick and sprayed Mace or pepper spray in first-class to push passengers and flight attendants to the back. They said they had a bomb. About five minutes after the hijacking started, Betty Ong hit up the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina",Who took action outside of her training?,Who did somethin' outside they training?,Lewis,Lewis,0,0,"The answer is **1**. 

Here's why:

* The paragraph states that Daniel Lewin, a former Israeli military officer, ""might've tried to stop the hijackers"". This suggests he acted outside of the typical passenger behavior in that situation, going beyond what would be expected of him. 
* The passage does not imply that the flight attendants acted outside their training. 
* While the hijackers are implied to be acting outside of their training as passengers, the question asks about an individual, making ""hijackers"" an incorrect answer.

Therefore, the statement that Lewin acted outside his training is true."
